in my opinion , the eu's handling of the migration phenomenon truly brings shame on europe .
the member states are reducing their development aid and preventing developing countries from achieving the millennium development goals .
this has my unconditional support .
for this reason , I have voted in favour of this impeccable report by mr claeys .
this agency is conceived as an important instrument of the common european strategy towards illegal immigration .
we greens did not see many problems there , so we voted in favour .
therefore , I am voting for the ep position .
furthermore , article 3 states thatmembers shall vote on an individual and personal basis .
agreements concerning the way in which the mandate is to be exercised shall be null and void . 
this situation is reprehensible , unacceptable and scandalous .
the case of our fellow member , mr tomaševski , entails , as it were , two problems .
therefore , I decided to endorse the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of valdemar tomaševski .
the karas report is in line with the european response to the greek crisis .
the european union has learnt a lesson from greece's experience .
the notion of turning eurostat into an audit institution was rejected five years ago .
however , what is relevant is that the proposal now has every chance of being implemented .
accurate , credible statistical data is a prerequisite for the economic and monetary union to operate properly .
such values should be established as early as possible in relation to the notification period .
this will allow them to assess the state of a country's public finances .
this report is another step towards monitoring the internal workings of countries , this time through statistics .
this report advocates absolute respect for the stability and growth pact .
it urges the introduction of unannounced controls on the budgets of the member states .
it builds up suspicion into a political doctrine by demanding that member states who falsify their statistics face sanctions .
the european project cannot allow itself to become confused with this authoritarianism which contradicts the sovereignty of the people .
it goes without saying that this is a scandal .
this kind of thing must never happen again .
only in this way will the stability pact be worth the paper it is written on .
i therefore voted in favour of this report .
if the previous data is known , there is no need for additional arguments .
harmonisation of statistical data collection 
standardising of statistical and budgetary information supplied by the member states 
i therefore voted in favour .
i supported this report .
i welcome the report on the european union strategy for the baltic sea region .
the baltic sea strategy is the first attempt to make use of macro regions .
this macro region will not be competing with the member states it will complement them .
this new form of governance will undeniably bring added value to local , national and european policies .
the purpose of the strategy is to solve common problems and to concentrate action on achieving shared objectives .
there are two major areas of interest for this region the environment and scientific development .
these are four particularly important steps for lithuania .
the only merit of this report is that it demands the elimination of pollution in the baltic sea .
this elimination is necessary for the preservation of our ecosystem .
it must be carried out as quickly as possible .
as for its stated desire to establish highly competitive european macro regions , this is completely unacceptable .
throughout these regions , they are aiming once again to dismantle the welfare state .
the remediation of the baltic sea region cannot be carried out in the way advocated by liberalism .
this is an important part of the external relations of the eu and its member states .
the baltic nuclear triangle being created is not just a concern for lithuania but the whole of europe .
in the eu , it is important to have a macro regional vision of the baltic sea region .
the eu cannot forbid the construction of nuclear power plants right next to the union's borders .
however , together we can negotiate with the belarusian government on the location of the construction .
this report advocates the importance of developing strategies for macro regions in the european union .
these are seen as a set of territories grouped around common objectives and challenges .
in writing . the eu strategy holds enormous potential for us and our neighbours within several policy areas .
optimal results can only be achieved with the pooling of resources towards commonly defined goals .
we also need to address the lack of appropriate infrastructure and accessibility between various transport networks .
the implementation of the strategy has been slow so far .
we need to kick start the process and step up our efforts .
i congratulate the rapporteur on a very well drafted report .
the document refers to several crucial issues the environment , energy and external affairs .
russia , belarus and norway should be involved in this cooperation .
interdisciplinary cooperation is needed here , including in the european parliament committees .
this macro regional strategy for the baltic sea is a pilot project .
the european institutions , in particular the european commission , should fulfil their role of providing coordination and support .
today , all the actors in our regions are affected by the crisis .
i supported this report .
a properly coordinated eu regional policy may strengthen competitiveness and employment in the eu's regions .
our smes , which make up 99 % of europe's productive fabric , need freedom from bureaucracy .
the european union and its member states are facing a major financial , economic and social crisis .
these measures can be financed by the payments committee of the european social fund .
i join the rapporteur in emphasising the particular importance of objective this is vital for facilitating the convergence of all the european regions .
this report focuses on the contribution of eu regional policy to resolving the economic crisis .
the objectives of the eu 2020 strategy must also be a driving force behind this issue .
this is a guideline which frames and enhances the eu 2020 strategy for intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth .
cohesion policy , through the structural funds and other actions , is of prime importance .
territorial cohesion helps boost the competitiveness of the various regions so as to make them as attractive as possible .
it also provides the perfect conditions for entrepreneurship and developing smes .
the aim is to mobilise the resources and tools required for granting financial support at local and regional level .
the positive response to combating the financial and economic crisis has demonstrated the importance of eu regional policy .
i fully welcome this report .
i abstained from voting on the report .
however , I have my doubts about the fixation on competitiveness that pervades the document .
this is to be done within the regional policy budgetary framework .
no proper impact assessments have been carried out in this regard .
they currently overlap one another , resulting in a lack of clarity .
it is important that these instruments are not solely used as fire fighting interventions .
implementation of cohesion policy programmes should be sped up in order to help these regions at this time .
however , it seemed preferable to me to abstain on amendment all of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
very many bus services in ireland are run by local carriers , small businesses and family businesses .
rural bus services are vital to rural life .
passengers should not suffer because of this proposal , either because of more restricted services or higher prices .
i support this regulation concerning passenger rights in bus and coach transport .
the persistence of varying levels of passenger protection depending on the form of transport being used is unacceptable .
i therefore voted in favour of the report on passenger rights in bus and coach transport .
the member states unfortunately work hand in glove with the transport operators , and oppose stronger passenger rights .
we note that the approved changes also improve on the previous version , by guaranteeing , in particular 
that carriers need to heed the appropriate access conditions for people with disabilities and those with restricted mobility 
these services should also be accessible to people with disabilities 
bus passengers cannot and must not be the only ones not to be protected by a union regulation .
i voted in favour and I congratulate mr cancian on his report , which I feel is thorough .
in most cases , in fact , bus transport is operated by small enterprises .
i therefore fully support mr cancian's proposal and his very well balanced approach .
journeys have been considerably democratised in recent years , and we have to be pleased about that .
i voted in favour of the cancian report concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport .
now we go into conciliation .
therefore , we have voted in favour .
in writing . the concerns with the report voted are the following 
in several of the amendments , responsibilities of compliance are addressed to the port authorities .
i also appreciate the fact that exceptional circumstances were taken into account in this report .
even if these circumstances remain extraordinary , they can pose serious problems to travellers when they arise .
this report also aims to facilitate assistance , retransportation , reimbursement and compensation for passengers in such circumstances .
all of this had to do with a vote at second reading .
it is crucial that consumers are given effective rights to ensure that liberalisation allows for real choice .
i would like to point out that safety conditions cannot be neglected and made relative in any circumstances .
the complaints system should be accessible and clear to passengers .
combating exclusion is a priority for the eu .
i therefore believe that the rights of passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility should be firmly guaranteed .
in writing . the new rights afforded to passengers on boats and ships are to be welcomed .
this means that there needs to be investment in terminals and ports .
these passengers should also have the opportunity to submit compensation claims .
in this case , too , it is primarily about accommodating people with particular needs .
however , we do not consider european legislation to be the right instrument for protecting passenger rights .
the netherlands itself is best placed to make tailored policy .
this compelled us to vote against this proposal .
for these reasons , I voted in favour of the amendments tabled to the council's position .
as is the case with the airline industry , passengers deserve to be protected against disruption .
consumer rights must be protected .
this legislation is heading in the right direction , giving more rights to passengers travelling by boat or coach .
passengers on maritime transport will have rights similar to those stipulated in european legislation for aeroplane and train passengers .
i welcome the adoption of the regulation concerning travel by sea and inland waterway .
i hope that an acceptable compromise can be reached in conciliation .
in order to solve increasing road infrastructure problems , there are proposals to deploy advanced information and communication technologies .
the effectiveness of using information and communications technology in the sphere of road transport is indisputable .
the correct functioning of the internal market must be ensured .
i voted for this document , because it would accelerate the implementation of intelligent transport system solutions .
the approval of this draft legislative resolution is an important step towards deploying intelligent transport systems .
if intelligent traffic systems are actually implemented , they must be interoperable .
some thought was also given to mutual recognition and data protection , hence why I am giving my approval .
in writing . the greens / efa have supported the jensen recommendation onintelligent transport systems.
the agreement with the council was adopted and the directive has been finalised at second reading .
i am pleased that it was adopted with a resounding majority .
thus , the formalities required by eu legislation should be simplified and harmonised .
creating a large european transport area without barriers is essential .
in writing . the verts / ale group supported the sterckx report on formalities for ships at seaports .
the agreement with the council was thus adopted and the directive has been finalised at first reading .
the eu airline industry is already in dire straits .
better performance and higher environmental standards are being sought in this report .
in my opinion , definite targets must be set if significant results are to be achieved .
transport is responsible for 25 % of co2 emissions in europe .
it is crucial to have cleaner vehicles and more efficient transport systems in order to reduce this impact .
the reality is a bit different , however .
there is not much evidence of collective ambition .
the transport sector is of great importance in the european internal market .
this sector effectively enables the free movement of people and goods throughout the eu .
i would therefore like to point out that the decarbonisation of transport should be a priority .
in this context , it is worth noting the possibility of internalising external costs .
the grosch report is an excellent starting point as we await the european commission white paper .
the report calls for safer , more efficient transport which causes less pollution .
in other words , nothing but very conventional and very obvious things .
today's vote calls for more joined up thinking across the whole of europe .
i endorsed the final version of the report .
instead of making the fund more flexible , we have obtained a fund which has no flexibility at all .
i would like to thank the fellow members who voted to reject amendment transport has a multifunctional nature , with direct influences on economic , social and territorial matters .
i voted for this report because I support the aim of european transport policies .
i am voting against this report .
it also contributes to the development and consolidation of the internal market .
we are as far away as ever from achieving sustainability in transport .
this report is basically almost a rehash of old , unfulfilled strategies .
that is why I abstained .
the european economy , and therefore employment , depends on the sustainable future of transport .
the verts / ale group voted in favour .
we support the resolution despite the risks posed by overly extremist stances already taken by parliament .
we must balance the need to protect the environment with the current economic crisis we are experiencing .
we look positively on the heavy emphasis on safety .
this report will affect a forthcoming green paper on an integrated transport policy .
i voted against the report , as it advocates the total liberalisation of transport policy .
unfortunately , however , the finances allocated to this sector are inadequate .
this is why I voted against amendment however , the effects of the financial crisis on the transport sector should not be overlooked .
there is more to transport than merely trucks , traffic and tariffs .
it also boosts employment .
i was pleased to hear the results of today's vote .
the grosch report has proposed the achievement of unusually ambitious objectives by 20i could not , however , agree with one of the rapporteur's proposals .
i have doubts about the proposal to create a transport fund .
parliament is directly elected by the public .
this allows an assessment to be made of the impact of european legislation on the everyday lives of citizens .
i believe that it is vital to create incentives for greater participation .
it is clear that european legislation has a direct impact on the public .
i voted in favour of the annual report by the committee on petitions .
thus , the outcome could have been better .
this is therefore an instrument of democracy and citizenship .
i do have one small regret that french citizens make very little use of this procedure .
according to the report , 46 % of submitted petitions in 2009 were deemed inadmissible .
this is far too high a number .
petitions are important because they give the european parliament a means to connect with its constituencies and vice versa .
these objectives must be maintained through sustained efforts from both member states and the european commission .
this own initiative report aimed to identify the current difficulties and to propose some solutions .
as I am completely in agreement with these objectives , I voted in favour of this report .
of course , this is not just a question of affirming these objectives loudly and clearly .
my amendments to the text were inserted in this vein .
in actual figures , this means that nearly 6 million young people are currently unemployed .
the only possible outcome from this is a needless long term burden shouldered by european and national budgets .
it is up to member states to invest in job creation at political and economic level .
other social and economic risks and costs to our societies are associated with this pre eminent problem of youth unemployment .
i feel that we cannot be resigned to losing young europeans to social exclusion .
it is unacceptable that some member states are planning a lower minimum wage for young people .
the economic crisis has , of course , also resulted in higher unemployment in the european union .
the impact of this has been heaviest on young people and persons approaching the age of retirement .
unemployment among young people is a huge problem .
mrs turunen's report is the first step , and I fully support it .
youth unemployment is one of the most pressing problems facing europe .
at the same time , the eu must be united when it comes to common strategies .
a coherent combination of educational , financial , social and employment policies is required .
that is why we abstained .
people under 25 are the first to be affected by the current economic crisis .
it is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships .
the representatives of the german free democratic party in the european parliament have supported this .
this is an unsustainable situation .
internships should not destroy jobs .
we believe that this gives a wrong message .
it should still be possible to do a three month unpaid internship , for example .
there are numerous non profit making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting , interesting experiences .
however , such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship .
the key factor should be the duration of an internship .
from then on , remuneration should also be paid .
the decision made today is impracticable and goes too far .
we therefore do not support this part of the resolution .
young people should not remain unemployed more than four months this is a statement with which I agree .
youth unemployment is one of europe's most pressing problems .
all member states must take action and fight youth unemployment by taking national specificities into account .
we must ensure growth and create new jobs , especially for young people and prioritise business education provider cooperation .
i voted today for the own initiative report on combating youth unemployment .
by adopting this report , we have decided to take strong action against the abuse of internships .
the commission and member states were asked by parliament to recommend minimum standards for internships .
a european quality charter on internships is to be proposed .
i am therefore in favour of promoting the status of internships .
this sends out a clear signal to our young europeans .
we often say that young people are the future of europe .
it is awful that the youth unemployment rate is double the average european rate .
unfortunately , the outlook is not promising either .
unemployment among young people is one of europe's most pressing problems .
that is why I voted as I did .
it is mainly young people and women who are affected by unemployment .
this trend continues to grow during the recession .
the actual process of getting on the job ladder is becoming increasingly difficult .
insecure jobs mean that we should not be surprised at low birth rates .
let us try , with the council and the commission , to guarantee young people a decent wage .
the crisis has hit hardest at those who are just entering the labour market .
i have no doubt that unemployment among young people is currently one of the eu's biggest problems .
even if young people do find work , they are very often only given temporary contracts .
internships are also the cause of much emotion .
the european union must have common strategies .
this specific paragraph for the whole of europe has been added at a particularly difficult time for young people .
in an ideal world , youth unemployment would be outlawed .
since 2000 , youth unemployment in brussels has never fallen below 30 % .
that is the thrust of the turunen report .
it sketches new ways to curb youth unemployment .
we must also ensure that these are of good quality .
the report was adopted with a large majority in favour .
it is fundamental for the europe of the future to guarantee full and secure employment for young people .
europe must have the courage to invest in those businesses which do not relocate but create jobs .
vocational training is indispensable .
there should be a quality charter to ensure that apprenticeships provide a reasonable income and are of limited duration .
addressing this is an important task for responsible politicians .
with 21.4 % of young europeans under 25 unemployed , it is definitely time to take action .
in lithuania , last year , every eleventh young person was unemployed compared to every twenty fourth in 200we need to boost youth employability by helping adapt educational skills to labour market needs .
support measures such as quality internships , apprenticeships and traineeships can aid a smooth transition from education to employment .
for lithuania , it is vital to prevent an increasing brain drain of skilled labour .
i voted in favour of the gruny report , whose aim is to launch a vast european employment initiative .
my contribution was based along two lines .
firstly , the importance of the link between training courses and the needs of the labour market .
it also promotes the view thatself employmentis the type of work that should be promoted .
i am voting in favour of the bulk of the measures proposed in this report .
these have a greater impact on young people and women .
the first relates to the need for increased investment in skills and professional and lifelong training .
these workers are often denied important rights including the right to training or to join a trade union .
the crisis should not serve as a pretext for the development of more precarious employment .
all workers should have access to equal treatment regardless of their employment contract .
i fully support the report and I will vote in favour of its adoption .
inflexible models of labour law have proven to have failed .
society has evolved , the world has changed , and labour relations must necessarily accompany this change .
a set of basic rights for all employees should be secured , regardless of employment status .
i still advocate the urgent extension of protection to work undertaken in atypical forms of employment .
the eu cannot abandon its european social model , but should rather strengthen it .
many of the report's articles are an example of this , namely , when it says that it 
unemployed people and workers must not expect a welcome from brussels quite the opposite !
the crisis must not serve as a pretext for the development of casual work .
all employees must be protected by labour law , whatever form their contract takes .
today's labour market and its associated employment relationships are characterised by one word flexicurity .
i therefore support mrs gruny's report .
i today voted in favour of the gruny own initiative report on atypical employment contracts in the eu .
this allows us to send out two clear messages to the labour market .
atypical employment contracts must remain the exception in europe .
the transition must be made to stable , protected , better quality employment contracts .
the fast pace of structural change necessitates more flexible forms of working .
the abuse of atypical employment breaches the european social model .
dialogue and collective negotiation can contribute greatly to improving and preserving the labour market .
the report adopts well defined guidelines and specific measures for safeguarding jobs , ensuring high quality employment throughout europe .
the european union is facing a major financial , economic and social crisis .
in writing . the report as adopted in committee has been adopted in plenary .
the text is not damaging but relatively weak .
there was , unfortunately , no chance to secure a majority for it .
the incidence of atypical employment contracts is increasing significantly in the european union .
the analysis presented in the gruny report is therefore good and to be welcomed .
we therefore go further in our alternative resolution .
there must not be two classes of employment contract .
that resolution did not make it , and parliament passed up an opportunity to construct a stronger social europe .
action is certainly desirable , therefore , and so I welcome the position of the whole european parliament .
this is important .
nevertheless , I believe that the eu should not involve itself in the forms of employment .
this is a matter that must instead be dealt with at a national level .
in my home country , collective agreements to deal with these matters are negotiated by autonomous parties .
increasing resource efficiency in europe is among the priority objectives of the eu 2020 strategy .
allow me to give you one example of this .
biogas is a precious resource used to produce electricity and fuel for transport and for supplying the gas network .
bio waste has a role to play in a more global matter the fight against climate change .
we must therefore totally separate bio waste from standard waste , which is the worst solution in the long term .
instead , we should use it for composting or for producing bioenergy , as the report strongly emphasises .
finally , there is a great diversity between the member states in terms of the current management of bio waste .
in order to manage bio waste effectively , the priority should be waste prevention or reduction .
effective bio waste management can contribute to the eu target of at least 20 % renewable energy by 20selective collection and recycling of bio waste is essential to europe's sustainable development .
the new legislation should stipulate the requirement for a system of selective bio waste collection and recycling .
treatment of waste is a problem that affects europe and all of humanity .
firstly , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr fernandes , for his excellent work .
current legislation in terms of bio waste does not answer the requirements of the material's regulation .
efficient management of bio waste not only brings environmental benefits but also contributes positively to the social and economic spheres .
i am therefore voting in favour of this report's proposals .
ever greater areas are experiencing irreparable soil degradation here .
globally , bio waste is most often put in landfills and only a tiny percentage is sorted and reprocessed .
europeans now understand the need to sort waste .
however , bio waste almost always ends up in landfills .
the report deals with the issue adequately , and I will vote in favour of its adoption .
it is estimated that the amount of bio waste produced in the eu every year is around 100 million tonnes .
our position is ambitious and realistic .
although we broadly agree with these principles , we cannot , however , neglect to point out some problems .
the question unanswered in the report is who will pay ?
reduction is one of the best ways of combating problems related to waste .
as regards composting , it is not enough to say that we need to do it .
the satisfactory management of bio waste would therefore have not only environmental advantages , but also economic ones .
action must be taken at the eu level and today's vote should ensure that progress is made .
this report takes the right approach .
i will therefore abstain .
bio waste can also be reused to produce bio energy and biofuels .
the recycling industry currently creates around 250 jobs for each 10 000 tonnes of waste recycled .
one strategic objective of waste management policy is to transform the eu into a recycling society .
this means that sustainable development can be promoted through efficient resource management .
in writing . the draft report already contained the most relevant issues for us greens .
this was included in the recitals of the text adopted in committee .
we are in favour of the commission's green paper on the management of bio waste .

economic governance in the eu and the eurozone , and surveillance of national budgets debate 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , economic governance constitutes a crucial challenge for the future of our union .
commissioner olli rehn then discussed this with you during his hearing .
unfortunately , the crisis has shown that we were right .
as a result , the commission provided detailed proposals on 12 may .
these proposals do not involve changing the treaty .
we must act now , within the legal context that we have today .
this is not a limitation .
our citizens , our businesses and our economy are demanding that we take initiatives .
it is our responsibility to decide and to act now .
because of the economic crisis , the european union has been faced with a series of serious tests .
as I said this morning , a deal is within reach in the coming days .
our response to the crisis is a holistic one .
we stabilise , we consolidate and we modernise .
we prepare our social market economy to ensure a better future for our citizens .
but for now , let me focus on governance .
we have the treaty provisions in place which allow us to act .
we have the institutions .
we need to make it work .
we faced a real risk and we successfully resisted it .
now we are filling in the gaps we have identified to pre empt such risks for the future .
i first announced to parliament the ideas we fleshed out in the commission communication of 12 may .
our debates since then are reflected in the commission communication of 30 june .
this work has helped to build a real european momentum .
i hope that this will translate later into a swift consideration and swift adoption of legislative proposals .
our approach to economic governance is to have rules that are more comprehensive and more efficient .
we need a stronger surveillance regime .
what does this mean in detail ?
first , we need more coordination .
key to this is theeuropean semester.
it will enhance economic transparency and encourage peer reviews , ex ante , among member states .
second , we need the credibility that comes with better enforcement .
this means a refined incentives and sanctions toolbox , a more effective mix of both preventive and corrective action .
i want to be very clear on this .
parliament can be reassured that the commission will do its utmost to ensure that this will be the case .
the timing of measures is also key .
we must not fall into the trap of waiting too long before sanctions kick in .
incentives and sanctions must be brought upstream so that action is deployed before the situation gets out of hand .
preventive action can be much more effective than corrective action but it requires discipline and political will .
we are addressing this in our proposals , in particular , as regards the euro area .
third , our surveillance needs to capture all the key elements .
it must not be restricted to fiscal policy alone .
we have seen that such a narrow perspective does not work .
we must have tools to detect macro economic imbalances among member states .
such imbalances weaken the cohesion of the eu and , in particular , of the euro area .
a comprehensive scoreboard of indicators will give us what we need to identify increasing divergences and to propose remedies .
they need , of course , to be complemented by appropriate enforcement mechanisms for such remedies .
that is what our europe 2020 strategy is all about . the european council endorsed it a fortnight ago .
i would like to underline the historic dimension of the reforms we are putting forward .
this is a strategy for the whole union . this is not just an addition of different strategies .
applause 
president barroso , commissioner rehn , your proposals are an important step towards strengthening economic governance in europe .
it also wishes to cooperate on taking the next step towards the community method .
we have great expectations of the european semester and the coordination of national action programmes .
important reforms and painful measures in the member states are necessary in order to strengthen their competitiveness .
this will create jobs and prosperity for our citizens .
you called the series of measures atoolbox.
a great deal will depend on the specific contents of this toolbox .
one of our dutch football teams has the mottodeeds not words.
fiscal stability cannot exist in isolation from strong economic growth and high levels of employment .
in your proposals of last week , I think you are missing the point .
you have left out several highly relevant options that would really mean a qualitative leap in this field .
second , you must come forward with an economic policy agenda for jobs and fiscal consolidation .
today , we only have an agenda for cutting deficits at the expense of jobs .
taxation on labour is far too high in a number of member states .
i hope you will reconsider and come forward with a more balanced set of proposals in the autumn .
the commission has the initiative here .
nevertheless , mr president , some questions remain concerning this package .
the first question , which is fundamental , is who will manage this economic governance ?
we cannot just say that we will reduce the deficits .
the fourth element is thestress tests.
i am satisfied with the fact that the decision has been taken to publish these .
this is a crucial point .
furthermore , this element is repeated in the commission's proposals .
the member states have not yet understood .
mr president , many thanks for making this statement .
it also specifically mentions imbalances .
until recently , it was still almost impossible to talk about imbalances seriously .
this obviously means economic governance and also talking about tax issues .
these must stop being taboo subjects and obviously have a place in such a statement .
secondly , it is not enough to coordinate budget policy only in the way it was described .
we must ensure that budget policy is anti cyclical , enabling it therefore to counteract crises .
unfortunately , this does not feature in the text .
unfortunately , you are still lacking the courage to explain things as clearly as is necessary .
we have problems with asset prices and bubbles .
this is not mentioned explicitly either .
it is no longer enough now to make progress in this crisis .
we need to arrive at consensus .
the outcome needs to be fully implemented by all 27 member states and be fully complied with .
the recent financial and economic crisis has necessitated bold measures .
i do not agree with this conclusion .
both the commission and council are calling for further controls and penalties for member states in deficit .
this has not worked in the past and will not work in the future .
regulation of the financial markets is a matter of urgency .
we will do our part to resolve the situation .
europe's citizens already have to pay the council now ought finally to swing into action as well .
this may stall growth in the euro area , which is still feeble and at risk .
these countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead .
what is needed is to carry out a fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its conditions .
i think you had an urgent appointment .
you are in such a pickle actually , are you not ?
what in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually tore up your own rule book .
you threw it away !
i am not a johnny come lately to the demise of the euro .
it was always written in the runes , as it were .
to suggest now that we have only just found out that greece was broke is intellectually dishonest .
our commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible problem because they buy junk debt .
they redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple a ratings .
what are our central banks doing now ?
the very same thing .
you had promised the convergence and the harmonisation of the european countries .
today , you are rushing us towards a social and political explosion .
errare humanum est , perseverare diabolicum to err is human , to persist is of the devil .
first of all , to corien wortmann kool , thank you for your support .
that is precisely our goal with youth 20so our proposal is not only about prudence in macro economic aspects .
that is why I also do not agree with the idea that our approach is not balanced .
we will come with formal proposals .
what is going on is a very important reform .
but we also want to include in this holistic approach macro economic surveillance with tif .
it is not only about sanctions for those who do not fulfil the criteria of depth and the deficit .
we will also try to reinforce coordination in terms of the macro economic imbalances .
we need this since our whole reform is based on this new architecture .
in the last few days , a new belgian presidency has renewed momentum towards a deal .
there is a predominant sense of constructive pragmatism on both sides .
i am grateful for the ambition parliament has been demonstrating .
i am grateful for your strong support .
i believe it now appears within grasp .
the commission has contributed through various compromise texts and is very pleased that progress is being made .
we now call on both colegislators to maintain the positive dynamic .
president obama said in the g20 that he got a bipartisan agreement .
great , and we welcome that .
finally , some of you spoke about stress testing .
at the last european council , I made a strong plea to make the results public .
a fully transparent stress test provides the opportunity to do so .
so , as you see , we are acting on several fronts .
i believe that the stability of the euro is in the interest of all our citizens .
applause 
president barroso , thank you for your approach and for your cooperation with the european parliament .
the debate is closed .
written statements rule 149 
in writing . I welcome the proposals made by the commission .
europe is about mutual and close interdependency .
however , control mechanisms are not a solution but just a means .
they should not be overestimated .
the solution is in more efficient work , entrepreneurship and innovation .
the key to the solution is prevention .
special attention should be paid to budgetary frameworks and the state debts .
instead of breaking financial control into smaller clusters , monitoring of the macro economic situation as a whole is needed .
the new dual system of incentives and sanctions deserves support .
i also encourage making better use of eurostat .
reliable and timely data is a crucial component to making the right decisions .
i should like to draw fellow membersattention to the problem of national budgeting .
this is all the result of illogical and unclear tax legislation .
in individual cases , tax authority personnel can apply thisturbidlegislation in any way they choose .
this has led to the bankruptcy of many businesses and commercial structures .
what is happening in the tax sphere in latvia today can be described in one word illegality !
in essence , the state is depriving entrepreneurs of their liquid funds .
the next item is the joint debate on the following 
rapporteur . mr president , at the origin of this financial crisis are the national supervisors .
at this stage , and with the huge crisis we are suffering , there are only two possibilities .
the uk splits the main financial regulator and gives more power and more clout to the bank of england .
mr osborne said that it had failed to prevent the crisis because no one knew who was in charge .
to close my speech , this is not time for a debate on a second order reform .
applause 
the trialogues began the following day .
when including this item in this plenary sitting , we had anticipated completing the negotiating process by this date .
as colegislators , we need to continue making an effort , as this agreement is still possible .
this leaves some leeway for reaching a compromise at a first reading within the next few weeks .
it is not a case , therefore , of a regular , generalised review .
the commission has been given the necessary powers to ensure its adoption within the anticipated timeframe .
all competences and powers have been incorporated into the sectoral legislation .
i hope that the negotiations on this directive can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion .
parliament has the following message , which is supported by a large , overall majority .
since then , we have had a wide ranging discussion about many issues .
they also would have expected these authorities to be granted strong investor and consumer protection rights .
this is the decision we have come to now in parliament .
there also seems , fortunately , to be a broad consensus that this step is necessary .
we also insisted in parliament on the new authorities receiving rights allowing them to ban risky financial products .
this was another case where we had to fight against the suggestions being watered down .
the key point remains if a real financial crisis breaks out , who declares the emergency ?
will the council ever do this ?
it is insisting that the fox should be put in charge of the henhouse .
this does not make any sense , a fact which the commission has also continually pointed out .
so far , the council appears inflexible .
it must be a case of large sums being allocated by means of a decision at european level .
it is now over to the council .
since then , the commission has done its work .
it commissioned a report from jacques de larosière .
first , there are the issues concerning efficiency .
we do not need a safeguard clause .
on this question , I would nevertheless like to make a comment .
who do the member states want to protect themselves from when they plan safeguard clauses against europe ?
we also want these authorities to be located in a single place , for reasons of efficiency .
on this matter , we have also made some requests .
we have also asked for greater openness from these bodies .
i would like to say one final word relating to the united states .
i am always shocked when people tell us that the americans have pulled ahead .
i also notice that a number of governments are having discussions in two stages .
first , we refuse any federal state .
we refuse any new stage of integration and we decry the community method .
then , later , we always compare ourselves to the united states .
there comes a time when we have to abide by our responsibilities .
i want a stronger europe .
madam president , cassandra had a gift that of telling the future .
she also bore a curse that of not being listened to .
for this reason , troy fell .
they can only be supervised by european authorities .
we did not take heed of this , and the crisis erupted .
exotic products , unknown even to their creators , flooded the markets .
nobody trusted anybody else , nobody lent to anybody else , and credit dried up .
now what ?
parliament has given a great deal of ground in order to reach an agreement the commission too .
the belgian presidency has shown great willing .
it has asked us for time .
there are several ideas that parliament would like to highlight .
what does it mean to say that they are european ?
national supervisors cannot be feudal lords invested with absolute power .
this governs everything except systemic institutions .
lifeboats should be made ready before the voyage , not in the middle of a storm .
what cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again .
the council has asked for time .
parliament has given it time .
let nobody be confused , however this is not a sign of weakness .
this is a sign of the strength of this house .
it must not make use of this time to try and put together blocking minorities in opposition to parliament .
i ask the council to listen to cassandra for once .
today , cassandra is the rapporteurs who have spoken .
cassandra is also commissioner barnier .
those who are not cassandra know only too well to whom I refer .
listen to parliament , seek an agreement , say here what was said in toronto .
do not say one thing here and another there .
god and this house .
it remains the most comprehensive piece of sectoral financial services legislation voted on in this parliament .
as such , solvency ii is intimately linked with the proposals for eiopa .
it is perhaps because of my experience with solvency ii that I was keen to take on this report .
i knew that it was the context in which we could make solvency ii really work .
insurance is not banking and I am glad that my fellow rapporteurs have accepted that .
they will not be different but they will be balanced .
this is a real gain for parliament .
for pensions , the question is up in the air .
we need to attribute wider powers of intervention to the supervisors .
we need to prepare contingency plans .
this entire process takes time for 27 member states .
however , around 50 of the 12 000 banks operating europe represent 70 % of assets .
this means an enormous concentration of risk , but also an opportunity to intervene primarily in them .
as you well know , the latest trialogue actually took place yesterday evening .
should the chair of the esrb be elected , or should he or she be automatically the ecb president ?
should the president of the efc participate in the work of the esrb ?
there again , an agreement is not far away .
i count on your support on these very important endeavours .
there are many subjects which are part of this architecture of prevention , crisis management and supervision .
there is also financial corporate governance and banking capital .
i will come back to this when talking about mr karasreport .
i would like to say a few words on the two subjects for today .
first , I will address supervision , which is effectively the backbone .
we need this credible european architecture of supervision .
we find here the spirit and the philosophy of the commission's proposals .
i am thinking of the reinforcement of the joint committee , as advocated by mr skinner .
these are only a few examples the most difficult things still lie ahead of us .
i want to repeat what mr garcía margallo y marfil said .
we need the council to understand that now is the time to act and to make progress .
others have also said this .
the ball is in its court to use these few days to reach an intelligent and credible agreement .
you can count on me to be available .
i have myself believed in precautionary measures for a long time .
that is the spirit of the toolbox that we will be presenting to the council of ministers .
i make the commitment that a legislative text will be presented to you .
i would like to say that I am speaking as the shadow rapporteur for the opinion .
there have been different approaches adopted at national level .
it is obvious that this cannot work .
what citizens want is for an effective decision to be made to get problems resolved .
the council only takes a narrow minded approach .
the public do not find this policy acceptable .
we expect the council to take action .
this means he can issue warnings , make recommendations , and all of this in public .
i really do regard this as an extremely positive move which should be highlighted .
madam president , commissioners , european supervision of financial markets is the minimum that we can do .
it will require the regulation of rating agencies .
as a result , the issue of control has not been resolved the control must be political .
it is also insufficient if we do not take real measures against the flight of capital to tax havens .
a regulation at the european level is useful , but insufficient .
we must have global supervision of financial markets .
we cannot simply allow things to carry on in this dysfunctional and incoherent manner .
equally , the new european framework must radically improve both the quality and coherence of regulatory supervision .
our member states are right to resist such a move .
the uk and germany are right to adopt the positions that they have .
let us now begin the debate with the political group speakers .
the problem has already been explained .
we are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays .
member states still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment .
this is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the european parliament .
as is well known , the european parliament is not an army of extremists making revolutionary demands .
our proposals are those of de larosière , not robespierre , as the fine commissioner barnier knows .
friends in the council , even if you are not here , you will read our words .
dear friends in the council , do not bury your heads in the sand like ostriches .
reality is tough , but it must be faced with choices of courage and strength .
if they are toxic , why authorise them ?
it is obviously asking for binding actions .
all of this does not seem to me to amount to extremism .
i can think of no other name for that than a political federation .
here lies the essence of the entire debate on financial architecture and the supervision of financial architecture .
we have currency union .
the citizens sitting here and watching us may quite rightly ask so what is your solution ? 
we need to do something without giving you a say . 
in my opinion , that is the wrong approach .
the council and the governments do not want strong intervention rights .
mr giegold is right when he described what is currently going on asparochial.
we will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets .
this would be just the first step to a status quo ante .
it is finally time for the grandiose promises to be backed up by actions .
my group supports strong european regulation .
i wonder , however , whether the road we are about to embark upon is the right one .
finally , I am convinced that politics should take more responsibility .
de madam president , the european union already has around 40 eu agencies .
every year , these organisations gobble up eur 1.5 billion .
the council and member states have never had any problem making quick fire decisions to establish such agencies .
most of all , there is frequently no rationale given for these agencies .
unfortunately , they often take a ridiculous stance .
in this debate on european supervision , parliament has played this role .
why is this ?
in these troubled times , the european systemic risk board must get to work as quickly as possible .
however , this is only a start .
the unity of the european single market must also be supervised if we want to avoid its fragmentation .
they are also concentrating more on substance than on a turf war .
standardised derivatives will be traded on established exchanges and forced through clearing houses .
we are discussing how to distribute the powers between european institutions and national institutions .
well , the solution is quite easy .
instead , oversight should begin in our countries .
in italy , for example , it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor situations well .
furthermore , why should the headquarters of the european agency be in frankfurt ?
who decided that ?
it should also contribute to the emergence of a single banking market of the union .
i am glad that it appears that we are close to agreement .
in retrospect , it seems astonishing that we did not have a single eu wide macro prudential body doing just this .
i am extremely pleased to see how close we are to a final agreement .
we should all , and the rapporteurs themselves , be very proud .
de madam president , we need more supervision of the financial markets in europe too .
the economic and financial crisis has made it glaringly and painfully obvious that opportunities were missed in the past .
the european financial supervisory authorities must be provided with extensive powers .
they must not degenerate into empty shells which passively observe market developments .
the council must finally accept the european parliament as a legislator of equal standing .
there has certainly been no lack of preparatory work by the responsible meps .
numerous discussions have taken place and work has been carried out in parliament quickly and purposefully .
we are now waiting for the council to provide clear answers and concrete proposals in writing .
hu the crisis has taught us all some painful lessons .
the new supervisory authorities will serve exactly this purpose .
parliament should also make concessions .
finally , ecofin should be granted the right to announce an economic crisis .
fr madam president , I am happy to find my friend michel barnier in this chamber .
i am thinking of international public banking establishments and , in particular , of the european investment bank .
data which will be collected by those three institutions will be very important and will be partially confidential .
we must do everything in our power so that this does not happen again .
we need regulation and supervision .
we need independent , strong authorities in the interest of europeans .
what the united states has succeeded in doing , the european union must also do .
this is the only way open to us to change things , and this is why we must succeed .
however , efforts to create stricter regulation and closer supervision will not , by themselves , prevent potential crises .
we need more involvement from europe .
the proposal tabled by the commission already provides a minimum scenario .
we need strong supervision with teeth , a right of intervention and a mediator function .
we need decisions without further notice in emergencies .
we require banking supervision as part of crisis management .
we need strong supervision with teeth .
it is very good that the union is not passive in ensuring financial security .
let us remember to link the responsibility of the union to the responsibility of all member states .
these intervention rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will hopefully never be used .
we want to keep systemic risks permanently to a minimum .
for the sake of taxpayers , we need more involvement from europe , not less .
if they fail to perform , they have somebody to answer to .
that is a key message .
i would like to conclude by saying that I have no problem with institutions being based in frankfurt .
after all , germany has been a better model of financial propriety than many others .
the problem is that we ignore asset inflation .
i will report all those matters to him which may concern him directly .
mrs bowles reminded us of the need for early intervention measures .
i think that these are good ideas .
we are indeed carrying out this reform for the citizens .
this is very much a reform for the citizens .
mrs lulling mentioned a point which is of interest to my colleague , olli rehn .
mr klinz , I would like to thank you for the support that you are showing us .
you reminded us of the importance of applying our rules properly .
that must be embarked upon , mr giegold , well before we talk about a ban .
i could imagine an important coordinating role for the authorities in this area .
the council also accepted that the authorities may have such a role .
mr baldassarre mentioned a worry that mr lehne also has concerning the powers of the authorities .
this has to do with the transatlantic calibration that I sometimes mention .
i am not worried about the energetic interaction between americans and europeans .
at the moment , 80 % of financial exchanges take place on both sides of the atlantic .
the other regions of the world are there , between the americans and the europeans .
we therefore have the same road map .
also , the last g20 was something of a follow up g20 , in my view .
the americans adopted a different method from our own they adopted a global package .
they will now need to open the drawers one by one to implement these decisions .
i think that there are real parallels between the americans and the europeans .
we are not always using the same tools , and we will not always use the same methods .
our banking sectors are quite dissimilar .
i would remind you that in europe , the banks finance between two thirds and three quarters of the economy .
in the united states , it is the other way around .
we do not always have the same banking structures .
on this subject , we are having a confident dialogue with the americans , but one without naivety .
that is what I would say in conclusion , and I thank you for your speeches .
in my case , I could argue that spain would probably have had a big corralito .
the euro was created 11 years ago .
i believe that we should make use of the time and reach a speedy agreement .
those who advocated self regulation in the past now need to accept self financing .
they have done an excellent job , which has not yet borne fruit .
it is a pity therefore that my fellow members are no longer present .
however , one thing which is also important to me is this compromise which we are now producing .
parliament tabled a last minute compromise last week .
it does not work if an inch being given ultimately results in a mile being taken .
this method will fail .
i hope that this signal is also clearly understood by the absent council .
otherwise , we are all going to find it very uncomfortable next week .
mr president , commissioner , I would like to say three things .
let us be quite clear .
we have made an effort .
this parliament agreed to interrupt the procedure of first reading .
this should not end up as cherry picking .
no .
i cannot mention all of them .
this is our line this is what we believe in for reasons of efficiency .
my second remark has to do with the date .
it is 1 january with good reason .
we have the advantage that we anticipated things that other institutions said later .
the president cut off the speaker 
he repliedno , it's much more serious than that.
i would like to thank everybody who has participated in this .
we have converged from different directions but we have come out with a strong parliament voice .
we should be proud .
on an international level , we should be proud too .
however , I do not necessarily agree with you on international financial accounting .
you will not be surprised to hear that .
i do not agree with using historical trends .
nevertheless , on supervision , the rapporteurs deserve a pat on the back .
we have gone through full time , we are now in extra time .
let us hope it does not have to go to a penalty shoot out .
i will try to be very brief here in underlining just four points .
a special mention for the office staff , for susana vravova , and for the services of the committee .
the joint debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
written statements rule 149 
the european union has a political , social and moral duty to intervene .
that duty finds its justification in the values underpinning the union and enshrined in the treaties .
the economy can only function with healthy financial markets dedicated to it .
european financial stability facility and european financial stabilisation mechanism and future actions debate 
we are the devils that look at the detail , and we want more of it .
on 11 may , the european stabilisation mechanism was established utilising the eu budget .
a bit more haste would have been useful , and perhaps cheaper .
can you confirm that the rules of the spv are being changed to permit this ?
there remain many other questions .
how will the coordination between the stabilisation fund and the imf operate ?
is this all the right way around ?
should the imf be topping up an eu rescue , or should it be the other way round ?
is the spv active now or must first calls use the eu budget mechanism ?
market forces are not popular right now .
mrs bowles mentioned angels .
i do not know if there are many angels when we talk of financial services .
the first question what amount are we talking about when we talk of this european stabilisation mechanism ?
what is the link with the ceiling on own resources ?
that is the precise response that mr rehn wanted to give to you on this point .
the second question will the commission carry out an impact analysis for these two instruments ?
this report will be transmitted to the economic and financial committee and the council .
notably , it will include an impact evaluation of the text .
the third question what is the impact on the financial capacities of the eib ?
it will not lend or borrow on behalf of this mechanism .
no exact choice of legal basis has yet been made .
you have just mentioned the question of the role of the european parliament .
the european parliament will be kept informed of any change regarding all of these new procedures .
the sixth question what is the coordination with the international monetary fund ?
the eighth and final question relates to the choice of legal bases .
this would have been difficult to reconcile with a long procedure involving an important role for some national parliaments .
however , I wish to say the following on the subject .
in our view , the financial stabilisation mechanism is not a substitute for developing a european monetary fund .
the financial stabilisation mechanism illustrates the urgency of financial market reforms .
in the meantime , the markets have done their job .
our fellow member , othmar karas , spoke of the stability pact .
today , we have a mechanism that was put together in an emergency , as you reminded us .
we did this in an emergency .
the president cut off the speaker 
this is a good course of action .
thank you for your understanding .
we now move on to the speakers in the catch the eye procedure .
besides , the issue arises concerning the dependency of rating agencies .
i find , therefore , that this measure has not been thought through well enough .
it poses the risk again of member states running up debts at the expense and liability of others .
i believe that this is the crux of stabilisation .
any reduction of this programme would be totally counterproductive .
would you have a suggestion to make on this ?
i would simply like to ask you a question , commissioner .
he will do this in writing in the next few days .
i refer you to the quite comprehensive response that president barroso gave on this question .
however , this is only a tool , mr karas .
these ideas will also be turned into legislative proposals at the end of 2010 and the start of 20mrs berès mentioned the application of the stability pact .
like you , I think that we must go further .
as you have understood , we introduced this european financial stabilisation mechanism in a time of emergency .
the commission has also made important proposals relating to budgetary surveillance .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 7 july 2010 at 12 00 .
the next item is the joint debate on 
it will force banks to hold more capital against riskier activities on the trading book .
we are constantly told by the banks that they have learned the lessons of the crisis .
it is therefore imperative that these rules on bonuses apply in 20colleagues , we have a duty , as legislators , to defend the taxpayersinterest .
we have a duty to respond to the public's concerns .
our voters demand and expect banks to prioritise stability and lending over bankersown pay and bonuses .
in the last two years , since 2008 , the banks have failed to reform their structures .
to begin with , it is important to exercise and expand sound internal and external supervision of remuneration policies .
the remuneration itself must reflect the company's long term performance as far as possible .
bonuses should not just be guaranteed .
a proportion of variable remuneration should be paid out over a sufficient period .
i think that we can go even further in this matter .
i agree with your observation , mr el khadraoui .
there must be binding measures on the remuneration policies of financial institutions .
the payment of bonuses to directors of banks receiving state aid is greatly restricted .
i think that that is fair .
i also welcome the fact that these measures must be implemented by the member states from 1 january 20this is one of the key elements of a more robust and more stable regulatory framework .
i have begun this task .
i recently put forward an international agenda for a financial regulation for growth .
this is one of the requests made in your report , mr el khadraoui .
we shall open a two month period of genuine consultation on all these issues .
thirdly , there is the matter of the modernisation of capital treatment .
i have just referred to crd 3 and the issue of remuneration .
i am very aware of this risk .
i am aware that these negotiations on crd 3 have sometimes been very difficult .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the council is again absent .
during the negotiations , the council came out on the side of the bonus recipients .
the european parliament is in favour of clear european regulations .
we are in favour of maximum limits .
we are in favour of payment methods involving less risk .
we are in favour of liability .
we are in favour of restrictions on bonuses for managers of banks supported with public funds .
we do not want cash amounts to be higher than the tied up capital .
we have managed to get our way with splitting the timetable .
it is also important that we have adapted the trading book and banking book .
we support this compromise as it takes us further in the right direction .
on the other hand , there have been very few specific measures .
this legislation will most likely reduce the short sighted and exaggerated risk taking in the financial sector .
that will reduce the risk level and increase stability .
it is too risky for society to largely accept the status quo .
yes , I mean up there alongside the supervisory architecture .
madam president , commissioner , my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted .
it is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors .
i must say , commissioner , that the commission has largely been on our side in this struggle .
therefore , I think that this is an achievement which we can share .
now , there is an important issue at stake .
as we lost , we have had to make compromises .
we have here a regulation which is unique on a global scale .
after all , any managers who are successful and responsible also want to continue making a good living .
this is a fundamental change towards greater sustainability and cost efficiency , and hopefully away from gambling .
thank you to all fellow members for their cooperation on this report .
it is clear that we need principles that promote and create guidelines for a sound remuneration policy .
at the same time , we must avoid broad generalisations and blaming the sector as a whole .
in the end , we succeeded in achieving a relatively balanced result .
de madam president , mr karas has already mentioned some key points .
i fully concur with him on them .
i think that we need better capital requirements for financial institutions in both qualitative and quantitative terms .
however , it does not help to force the situation as this could have totally the opposite effect .
the financial crisis is obviously a global crisis .
the lessons we need to draw from it must therefore be drawn at a global level as well .
this means that if we tighten capital requirements , we must coordinate this measure internationally too .
the level playing field must be retained .
calculation examples in the annex must also match the wording .
however , the future supervisory authority will be responsible for the interpretation .
there is one other thing we should not forget .
the financial economy and the real economy are not two self contained systems .
it will not be that easy to put an end to this .
the attempt to make management executives more accountable with retentions was thwarted by new insurance policies .
the eu draft should draw a lesson from this .
the factors determining the bonuses must definitely be transparent .
madam president , I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the commission .
we only know about the excesses of the banking sector because of the disasters that have happened .
transparency is the key to all of this .
when people have knowledge of what is happening , then we can take action on it .
clear rules have been implemented which cannot be interpreted in different ways .
this is the aim of the debates we are having with the council at this very moment .
this includes , mr canfin , decisions on rules relating to remuneration .
i should now like to say a few words about the application of these new rules .
they must apply to all investment banking firms .
mr christensen , you stressed the need for transparency .
mrs bowles mentioned the central issue of capitalisation , as did mr balz a short while ago .
capitalisation is indeed important .
we need to achieve exactly the same objectives .
they have been set by the gwe must achieve them in parallel , and I shall be careful to ensure that this does indeed happen .
i believe , colleagues , that it is the beginning of the process , not the end .
therefore , I urge colleagues to give a strong vote to this report in the plenary tomorrow .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I too shall keep it brief .
it cannot be the end of the story .
it is clear that there is still work to be done .
supervisors must be strengthened so as to enable external monitoring , too , of companiesremuneration policies .
the role of the shareholders must also be strengthened .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 7 july 2010 .
question time commission 
the next item is question time b7 0316 / 2010 .
the following questions are addressed to the commission .
part one
the answer isyes.
this implies that their involvement was necessary and in keeping with the nature of jtis as public private partnerships .
the eu staff regulations foresee disciplinary procedures for breaches of this obligation .
having said that , the regulations establishing the joint technology initiatives cater for smes .
they contain provisions encouraging and promoting sme participation and representation at governing board level .
let me describe an actual case .
i would therefore ask , commissioner , that you monitor the selection procedure .
the involvement of industry was of two kinds .
perhaps it would be helpful if I outlined how that was .
subject european union accession to the european convention on human rights
pl thank you , mr šemeta , for your answer .
unfortunately , I do not find it satisfactory .
the president cut off the speaker 
member of the commission . mr president , I will try to answer the question .
technically and legally , I understand the commissioner's response .
so , work is now in progress .
well , let us hope that it does not take too long !
subject international cooperation on tax havens and offshore companies
the president cut off the speaker 
your point is a really interesting one and we are looking at various forms of tax evasion .
this could also allow us to make progress in dealing with tax evasion .
for I suppose they do have some kind of justification , and they must be using it .
does the commissioner have a comment to make on that ?
i hope that we will be able to make progress in this area .
i am sorry , but the beginning of the second question was not very clear .
mr kelly , perhaps you could restate your question very briefly if you would not mind .
the first part of your question was not very clear .
does the commission agree with that statement ?
i will leave the question to the comments of those who made them .
we are now dealing with the current package , which includes three directives , and the issue of lichtenstein .
the commission started this dialogue last week .
sometime in the future , I will be able to inform you of the progress in this area .
part two
subject serbia macedonia kosovo cross border cooperation
how can the rule of law , investment , infrastructure and local border traffic be encouraged in the region ?
historically , the area has been underdeveloped and is currently the poorest in serbia .
the commission has been providing significant financial assistance since 2000 .
we intend to include kosovo montenegro as well , starting next year .
de mr president , commissioner , thank you for your excellent reply .
you yourself come from a wonderful region of europe , euregio egrensis .
people are really suffering a great deal there .
member of the commission . it would , indeed , be one of my priorities in this region .
the internationally recognised name of one of the three countries is fyrom , former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
it is unacceptable for this to be entered on parliament's list in an official debate .
subject full implementation by turkey of the association agreement and the additional protocol
has turkey made any commitment to sign the protocol in 2010 ?
on this basis , the council will be able to evaluate the situation and draw the appropriate conclusions .
one of them has been mentioned by you .
we now move back to mr kelly .
it is your second and last supplementary .
it is important to stress that we were not to know , as questioners , that this would happen .
indeed we have been pushing for a debate on the mercosur bilateral talks .
i totally agree with what mrs mcguinness has just said .
i am very angry , quite frankly , about the way this has been done .
it will provide a much wider opportunity for debate and discussion .
but let us see how we get on , mr gallagher .
if you want to be patient and wait , we will see how we get on .
the united nations framework offers an opportunity for such talks .
the european union has no competence to intervene in such cases .
ultimately , this regrettable situation results from the yet to be resolved cyprus problem .
there should be no pressure from any side .
as mentioned earlier , this is an issue for internal cypriot dialogue .
subject middle east peace
how is the commission using the european neighbourhood policy to bring positive results to bear on this situation ?
i would like to thank the commissioner for his reply .
what have you done to raise this question ?
member of the commission . I would like to start where the honourable member ended .
we should use to the maximum the channels we have and find new ones , as appropriate .
do we not need a new way of communicating our message ?
what is needed at this point in time is a political solution to the closure of gaza .
i apologise to baroness ludford , who has now left the chamber .
subject progress of democratisation in georgia and azerbaijan
does the commission intend to reward countries that have made progress in complying with european standards ?
this monitoring is recorded in the commission's annual progress report , which we issue every spring .
the commission continues to raise its concerns with the administration of azerbaijan and georgia at various levels .
mr füle , thank you for your answer .
member of the commission . I agree with the approach that neighbourhood policy is about reform for reforms .
subject infringement of fair trade rules by european importers
subject fair trade
on top of this , hundreds of local authorities are becoming fair trade towns .
commissioner mandelson took up the coordination of fair trade issues in dg trade in 200does the commission plan to keep this responsibility ?
one of their biggest assets is that they are non governmental in nature .
i would also recognise that there is considerable scope for consumer confusion .
i am pleased to hear that you are going to coordinate .
thank you for your brevity , commissioner .
as the author is not present , question 34 lapses .
subject draft eu colombia free trade agreement
subject eu colombia free trade agreement
this human rights clause should include the provision to suspend the agreement where human rights violations occur .
it is not yet clear whether the national parliaments would also be called on to approve the agreements .
i can confirm that the agreement with colombia and peru includes a broad clause on human rights .
thank you , commissioner , for that answer .
the high representative has described human rights as a silver thread that will run through all our external policy .
i have heard what the commissioner said about the suspension clause .
we are going to continue to monitor this very closely .
with respect to the question by david martin , yes , we have made that assessment .
in the end , it is a political assessment .
you know what the remedies are they are the right ones .
thank you commissioner .
thank you , colleagues , for your questions .
the chair of the european parliament is wholly impartial and independent , but I hope holland wins !
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers see annex .
that concludes question time .
the sitting was suspended at 20.30 and resumed at 21.00 
novel foods debate 
indeed , we often hold discussions here on food that has been tinkered with .
innovation is all well and good , but not at the expense of human life and health .
what exactly arenovel foods?
one example of this is nanotechnology .
the manufacturers would like to place this on the market .
consumers always love novelty , and indeed new technologies can help us combat obesity , for example .
a food should not reach our plates unless its safety is guaranteed .
now for the stumbling block meat from cloned animals and their offspring .
cloned animals are often crippled or diseased , and most are not even alive when they are born .
in other words , there is little sign of respect for animal welfare .
the discussion on cloned meat is not new .
the european parliament has been debating the cloning of animals since back in 200the council took the view that meat from cloned animals should fall under novel foods legislation .
therefore , parliament was unable to reach agreement with the council at second reading .
therefore , I make an emphatic call for separate legislation on the cloning of animals .
we must not produce any unpleasant surprises at the last moment .
i am grateful for parliament's broad support for the improvement of the proposal to streamline the authorisation procedure .
regarding animal cloning , I share the importance that parliament attaches to this highly sensitive issue .
i look forward to hearing the views of the members .
it deals with novel foods and new processes for manufacturing foodstuffs .
i agree that a new definition is needed , but we should not limit ourselves to definition and labelling .
i hope and trust that this will be the case .
the effects of nanomaterials on the human body are unknown .
we must do our utmost to guarantee safe consumption .
we represent citizens and we must not forget this fact .
most of us would also agree that the question of transparency is crucial when we address this dossier .
we therefore need to guarantee public access to data on which the risk assessment for novel food is based .
transparency should also apply when we speak about the labelling of products from animals fed by gmos .
these are foods manufactured using new production techniques , foods that did not exist before 15 may 199we want the commission to present a legislative proposal without delay , and we are really pushing for this .
the absent council has accepted only a very limited number of amendments from our first reading .
i hope the commission does keep its promise to produce not just a report but an actual legislative proposal .
i believe this is something the european public really needs and is calling for .
can these things affect our health ?
if so , should they therefore be included in a regulation on medicinal products ?
it makes sense to have eu legislation in this area , but there are many different interests involved .
who actually wants these new initiatives ?
is it the industry that wants to sell more products ?
or is it really the consumer ?
i do not believe it is the latter .
in europe , we can easily feed ourselves without the need for cloned products .
the precise purpose of these regulations is to safeguard food safety and human health .
unfortunately , however , the reality is much duller .
need I remind you that the technology being used to obtain such food is still experimental in many respects .
the group of the european people's party christian democrats cannot support her on every point .
we take a different view regarding additives and animals fed with feed derived from gmo plants .
however , she has done an excellent job .
i also want to thank our shadow rapporteur , mrs ayuso , for the excellent work she has done .
the following important reasons were put forward during the discussion in the group .
we do not need it .
the population is very evidently against it , as stated by all the surveys .
i am sure that we are not just talking here about a vague gut feeling .
it contains so many unanswered questions , justifying this sense of unease .
cloned animals suffer .
they often need to be put to sleep because they have terrible diseases .
animal protection is not just a principle which we can apply willy nilly .
the authors of the treaties have imposed this on us .
we must absolutely avoid creating laws which fail to take animal protection into consideration .
it is for these reasons that we will be supporting it tomorrow too , with a large majority .
we had an interesting debate too on this regulation , which was also filled with controversy .
commissioner , I believe that you said that we have a consensus .
with novel foods , we need prior authorisation before they enter the market .
this would not conform to the concept of the internal market and the uniformity of health and living conditions .
we are not calling for a ban on gmos and nanomaterials .
a great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals .
i would like you , commissioner , to remove this section from the novel foods regulation .
this would pave the way for a regulation on all the other topics which are not controversial .
an agreement was not reached between the parties during the trialogue .
we all know about the extremely rigorous cross compliance rules .
please take into account the rather difficult situation currently facing farmers and ensure fair competition for european farmers .
this is how we can recognise the benefits of certain healthier novel foods .
i find it regrettable to have only one ideological opinion on the issue of cloned animals .
the european commission has pledged to put a proposal to us .
do we not already have enough rules governing food ?
we certainly do need it .
if there is going to be a novel foods regulation , it should really only apply to novel foods .
the situation is different with regard to nanotechnology , which is a new procedure .
however , we should avoid demonising this new technology , as has often happened in the past .
we must not stand in the way of progress .
i am astounded at the information that is already available and at the research that has been carried out .
we certainly still need to do this with nanotechnology , but the opportunities which it opens up are huge .
we should continue to utilise and promote them .
i look forward to finding out what will be put before us .
these animals have suffered premature ageing or other diseases .
cloned animals suffer .
most cloned organisms have not survived or have died prematurely .
the success rate is one viable organism in 75 cloning attempts .
last but not least , cloning also raises issues about the safety of using these techniques .
this technique is still too dangerous to be used for the direct benefit of mankind .
it is a serious ethical issue .
we must guarantee that it is safe .
firstly , the legislation must have a scientific basis .
our decisions must be based on relevant research , and on objective and well conducted science .
it must not be a question of personal taste , religious conviction or particular interests .
consumers will reject novel foods if they cannot be certain that what we are offering is indeed safe .
the citizens of europe have a right to demand that .
this is at complete odds with innovation and development .
we must not impede or prevent new things , but we must guarantee that they are safe .
the situation in the european union regarding our meat supply is adequate .
there is no reason , therefore , to have to fall back on meat from cloned animals .
meat from cloned animals is definitely not a priori harmful .
however , risks cannot always be excluded either .
there is no reliable evidence available to show what kind of suffering such animals endure .
cloning is a clear encroachment on nature and we require a clear political decision on this .
not everything that can be made is also for mankind's benefit .
we must send out a consistent , clear political message to the commission and our citizens .
another important topic in this regulation is the rules on nanotechnology .
i call on the commission to table a proposal on this as soon as possible .
we only know that this technique causes suffering , hurt and pain to animals , which is often avoidable .
de mr president , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work .
this will take account of the high level of health protection in the european union .
stringent regulations and quality standards are constantly being imposed on and implemented by the agricultural sector in europe .
the precautionary principle must apply in particular in the food sector .
we do not need meat from cloned animals for the sake of food supply security .
as the european parliament we should , during the forthcoming second reading , .
the president cut off the speaker 
we need a new regulation in order to place novel foods on the market safely .
we certainly do not need meat from cloned animals .
there are a whole range of reasons why we do not need this meat from cloned animals .
our european citizens , who are our consumers , reject this product .
this is presented , on the one hand , as scaremongering and , on the other , as anti scientific .
i believe that we will benefit not only our consumers in doing so , but also european agriculture .
i , too , would like to express my admiration and thanks to the rapporteur .
at present , the european group of ethics does not see convincing arguments to justify .
the president cut off the speaker 
nanotechnologies have become widely used in food processing across the world .
in europe , we need well developed and researched products which we can guarantee are safe for human consumption .
products must be safe , tested and approved and labelled in a way that does not mislead the consumer .
the president cut off the speaker 
one asks oneself why should we ?
is there perhaps a shortage of meat stocks in europe ?
absolutely not .
this is not a valid argument .
is there enough information for consumers ?
can a consumer clearly understand and choose which is meat from a cloned animal and which is not ?
are they , by any chance , safe from a scientific point of view ?
well , we will be able to say in 50 years .
it took centuries to work out that penicillin could come from mould .
does europe , perchance , say yes to everything ?
no , because this europe does not want product provenance stated , it is against .
the president cut off the speaker 
first , the replacement of the decentralised authorisation procedure with a centralised procedure at eu level .
the safety assessment would be carried out by efsa and the authorisation decision taken by the commission .
fifth , clarification of the fact that all food products containing nanomaterials require case by case authorisation by eu citizens .
i look forward to a debate with the european parliament and council on this .
annex position of the commission
amendments 
indeed , much has been said about this , but the novel foods regulation is about very much more .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
written statements rule 149 
animals , moreover , should not suffer for human health .
thank you .
all citizens of the union are entitled to the necessary protection and security in this area .
industrial emissions integrated pollution prevention and control recast debate 
mr president , this debate was timed badly .
i would like to emphasise two aspects .
the first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants .
i have heard many arguments in this debate .
i do not like to remember my past , but I come from the former gdr , east germany .
we are not talking about things which are not available on the contrary , this is up to date technology .
this directive represents a significant step forward in the control of industrial pollution in the european union .
it also provides us with the opportunity to stimulate eco innovation .
mr president , I would like to begin by thanking mr krahmer for having pushed for ambitious legislation .
it is therefore worth voting for .
i am pleased that we succeeded in achieving this .
this places germany at a competitive disadvantage compared to others .
this is an argument that can apply to many aspects of environmental legislation .
there has to be a level playing field .
the question is that we have now recast this legislation .
member states have got off the hook .
my member state , the united kingdom , has got off the hook .
it has not done what germany did .
mr president , I shall keep it brief , as the netherlands uruguay match is still going on .
i shall keep it brief , then , as I want to catch the end of the game .
in the light of this , I am truly disappointed with the course of the negotiations .
nevertheless , when all is said and done , I am a definite supporter of this tightening up .
at the end of the day , that is what this is all about .
we are to be given a level playing field and we are to have clean air .
at the end of the day , however , we are making progress .
i believe that the match is now over , and that the netherlands has reached the final .
sadly , england could not be there , but never mind we cannot have everything .
we have reached , in the end , what is an acceptable compromise .
member states are not particularly happy .
certainly some members of this house are very unhappy .
i hope mr eickhout's unhappiness is mitigated later but , nevertheless , it is a good overall result .
at the end of the day , that is always the consumer .
this is also the approach we support for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions .
this commitment ensures that this varied reality will be observed .
this applies in particular to the transitional national plans which will apply to large power plants .
unfortunately , the electricity market is not yet a single market .
it will take time to achieve that objective .
commissioner , you said it yourself .
after all , the previous directive dates from 1996 that is , 14 years ago !
thus we have a great success , though it is spoiled somewhat by the large combustion plants .
the small fry are arrested , while the big fish are allowed to go free .
what happens so often in life is also unfortunately happening here with industrial plants .
cs it is clearly very important to press for reductions in emissions of hazardous substances by industry .
this process is very important .
this is the least we must do for the sake of human health and the environment .
even after this directive , the situation will not really be good anywhere in europe .
around 95 % of the polish energy sector is based on coal .
adoption of the krahmer report will put enterprises in a difficult situation .
this is economically and technically problematic .
this should be made to apply only to new investments .
it is based on dogmatic principles .
it leads to unsustainable development and unfair competition within the european union .
first , a degree of flexibility is maintained for businesses and for the authorities responsible for granting exemptions .
installations which come under the remit of this directive must be authorised .
i think that this directive should be linked to the european union's industrial policy .
pl mr president , I would like to comment on two matters .
the second matter concerns member states with a coal based industry and the draft directive .
the transitional periods for large combustion plants concerning so2 and nox emissions are particularly important to us .
i would like to congratulate all of the negotiators .
we need a controlled reduction of excess bureaucracy so that we can have more efficient activity .
we need concrete and compact guidelines which establish eu wide minimum standards .
we need the accompanying increase in efficiency in order to be able to protect our environment more effectively .
however , we also need an independent and objective controlling body which will ensure adherence to the new guidelines .
the agricultural sector therefore has a leading role to play in climate and environmental protection .
industry can now follow .
ro I approve of the compromise text resulting from the trialogues .
it will allow derogations to be agreed from the emission values accepted and based on the best available techniques .
these derogations concern cases where investment costs outweigh environmental benefits .
the upshot of all this .
the president cut off the speaker 
it is a pity , because it is a hugely important directive for both air quality and eu industry .
although we achieved a reasonable compromise , companies must invest in cleaning technology , which is not necessarily available .
plants will have to be closed prematurely and the costs to the consumer will be considerable .
the premature closure of plants would represent a cost that the resultant environmental benefit would not cover .
flexibility is still possible but must now be clearly justified .
the commission can collect information on the use of this flexibility .
you are probably aware that our proposal was for a shorter time .
i hope that I have already proved that in the first half of my mandate .
i think it is fair to say that we give industry time to build changes into normal investment plans .
that is what the compromise is bringing .
the fact is that we are moving .
it certainly has the support of the commission .
a good omen , I think .
who exactly it will be , we will see .
i do not want to express any preference now .
chris davies , many thanks !
that also does not happen every day .
it is certainly worth noting .
however , congratulations to our dutch friends , of course .
i wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen .
the first is that I understand all the worries and woes of my eastern european friends only too well .
as an east german , I am also half eastern european .
in order to get high level environmental protection , one has to be able to afford it .
we must deal with the fact that industrial processes in asia are always cheaper than here .
those which do not do this will become less competitive .
no one , including this law , is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow .
we have enough transitional periods , but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false .
. mr krahmer , congratulations on your excellent work .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
written statements rule 149 
at the moment , we are witnessing tentative development of alternative energy resources in certain regions .
this maintains considerable dependency on fossil fuels .
we must find solutions enabling us to invest in state of the art energy production facilities in the least polluting way possible .
industrial activity requires a high level of environmental protection .
this is particularly true for the prevention of air and water pollution , but also for biodiversity .
the main strategy emerging as a result is to combat environmental pollution at source .
it is also requested to support and monitor the member states in implementing the measures .
in this regard , cooperation with european confederations of industry , smes and ngos plays an important role .
losses to industry may be as high as pln 50 billion .
implementation of the directive will also have an adverse effect on thousands of polish businesses .
this is four years shorter than poland had expected .
extending the transitional period would make technological conversion easier for small heating plants .
in view of the above , the recommendation for second reading of the industrial emissions directive should be rejected .
obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market debate 
these operators must be aware of the wood's origin .
parliament would have liked a ban on the entire chain , and not just the first seller .
all parties must therefore take responsibility for ensuring that no illegal timber is sold in the eu .
the most blatant breaches of the ban on the sale of illegal timber should be treated as crimes .
we examined the sort of contexts in which this concept occurs in current legislation .
illegal harvesting also destroys biodiversity .
forests are of vital importance in maintaining biodiversity and in global climate and water cycles .
nowhere are the three pillars of sustainable development clearer than in relation to forests .
the challenge remains as to how we detect illegally harvested timber .
the proposal in front of you deserves your support .
it certainly has mine .
however , I must say that we worked well together .
i would also like to thank the spanish presidency .
i had three things in mind when working on this issue .
firstly , that timber is a wonderful and renewable material that we use too little rather than too much .
we must not impose higher requirements on timber than we do on oil , for example .
secondly , it must be possible to implement the legislation .
the export of timber and timber products was an important factor in sweden becoming rich once upon a time .
we must not prevent other countries that are currently poor from exporting and trading .
many of my objections have been heard , for which I am very grateful .
i think that we have achieved a great deal .
i see many friends here who fought hard with us .
this is absolutely absurd .
however , this legislation protects european citizens and european producers from unfair competition from cheap illegal timber .
it is also because today we are sending a very strong signal to the rest of the world .
this is a very important signal on the part of the european union , and should not be underestimated .
deforestation both legal and , in particular , illegal remains a major problem in the world .
fair is fair , however this signal is actually only effective thanks to the european parliament .
as far as I am concerned , this is a great victory for democracy .
unfortunately , if it is not enforced effectively , it will be a paper tiger .
this also goes for the shadow rapporteurs .
in my opinion , parliament has set an example of how it can operate and express its democratic power .
i am very happy to have been part of the successful negotiations to secure an agreement .
it is possible to come to such agreements when we all work together .
i would like to highlight one of the very welcome side effects .
it follows on nicely from what jan was just saying .
mr president , commissioner , I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs of this excellent work .
we are therefore also talking about the transfer of wealth from the producer to the countries consuming this timber .
this illegal practice places sustainable timber exploitation and the companies involved in it at risk .
nice sounding words are not enough .
this report takes a very important step in this direction by defining prohibitions on timber trading .
good intentions are not enough either .
effective means are needed , particularly penalties , which could be of three types in this case .
however , how far back should we trace timber , and which products is it realistic to check ?
i am thinking about furniture consisting of mdf and chipboard that is made of recycled wood , for example .
i hope that , with this proposal , we will be able to prevent that from happening .
i hope that the commission will put forward proposals relating to this as soon as possible .
it is important for our citizens , judging by my postbag and the number of e mails I have received .
the civil war in liberia , mainly funded through illegal logging , killed 250 000 people .
human rights watch says that usd 2 billion have been lost in tax revenues in indonesia .
so what we are doing today is a first step .
i would like to thank the commissioner for going further than his predecessors .
tomorrow , we will make a start .
he was sympathetic , but his services and lawyers said it could not be done .
it can be done , and here we have proof of it .
this is excellent , this is good news and an important measure .
what does that mean ?
one sees the wordseffective , proportionate , dissuasivetime and time again .
i would like you to be the first commissioner to actually ensure that those words have proper effect .
de mr president , I think that we are making good legislation today .
it would be much too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence of origin throughout the entire supply chain within europe .
this was on the table at the beginning of the debate .
therefore , we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance .
we have succeeded in doing this .
this is not only applicable to felling , and it will not work .
zero risk is not feasible .
it produces bureaucracy and , above all , produces new risks .
in this sense , this compromise is a good one .
i am pleased that we will be able to approve it with a large majority tomorrow .
we are surely all unanimous on that issue .
that should not be the purpose at all .
that , too , is now something to make us apprehensive .
this is an important example of how we should not work .
we have quite a bit to do in this area in the future .
we must try to avoid the sorts of problems that we have in connection with this issue in particular .
this is why it is imperative for europe to improve the legislative framework in this area .
however , it is not a perfect solution .
there are options for bypassing even this system .
however , further measures are .
the president cut off the speaker 
after all , 20 % to 40 % of worldwide industrial timber production comes from illegal sources .
around 13 million hectares of forest are deforested every year , as we have already heard today .
i would like to thank the rapporteur .
a decent society creates sensible rules .
decent people respect them , and decent governments should not have a problem with prosecuting thieves .
it is therefore necessary .
the president cut off the speaker 
on the contrary , it is because of the high level of consensus in the room .
and , yes , it is also an important part of the fight against poverty .
the impact of the regulation depends on effective implementation , and the challenge is far from over .
we are clearly dealing with a proposal of a noble nature .
i am looking forward to engaging in the implementation and enforcement process together with you .
i am glad that we have made possible what he thought impossible at the time .
many have been and are concerned about bureaucracy .
the companies should have the documents needed for this in any case .
it is required , for example , under the laws on vat .
they need to be genuinely effective in the prevention of malpractice .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
written statements rule 149 
nowadays , 20 30 % of industrial timber production worldwide is from illegal sources .
we need to clean up the european timber market as soon as possible .
while it could still be improved , the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous .
the regulation establishes a binding provision which delegates responsibilities on the basis of thedue diligence system.
in many cases , we see illegal extraction even in european union countries .
this is linked to the management of animals , especially the taller ones .
it is appropriate to resolve these questions at the corresponding national or regional levels .
the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left will certainly support the rapporteur's proposals .
illegally harvested timber and timber products have no place on our market .
this is also a human rights issue .
last week , dutch television showed how our energy companies profit from coal mining in south africa .
the spokespeople of these companies were turning a blind eye they lacked the courage to be publicly accountable .
similar practices occur in the deforestation sector .
we must eradicate these root and branch .
large scale logging drives people from the areas where they live .
i endorse the environmental and climate targets , whilst also advocating protection of human rights .

future of the cap after 2013 debate 
we are pleased to welcome commissioner cioloş .
i believe this to be an extremely positive detail .
what is the cap for ?
why is it still relevant in the 21st century ?
that is the scale of the challenge .
that would help to create jobs and provide real opportunities for farmers to diversify and earn extra income .
it cannot be right and justified to continue making payments based on how you farmed some 10 years ago .
we also have to address the issue of market volatility , but on this I would urge some caution .
yes , we still need intervention and private aids to storage .
yes , we need to examine other tools such as risk insurance and future markets .
yes , we need our special reserve budget line to fund action in terms of crisis .
that has already been tried and it has failed .
i would suggest that we do not wish to go down that road again .
as far as cross compliance is concerned , I think that it has had a positive impact on direct payments .
it has also clearly defined the starting point of public goods rightly remunerated from the public purse .
of course , we can simplify cross compliance measures .
as far as our group is concerned , this report conveys an ambition for european agriculture .
agriculture must be supported in this evolution .
the issue of generational change will be one of our concerns .
the report which we will adopt today includes proposals tabled by members representing political groups and individual member states .
we need the common european agricultural policy .
let us forget any thoughts of renationalisation .
this , of course , includes finding food for nine billion people .
let us not see agriculture as an environmental villain and environmental problem .
agriculture and forestry hold the fundamental solutions to our huge problems .
previous cap reforms have led to the liberalisation of agricultural markets .
they have given rise to profound injustices in the distribution of aid between countries , products and producers .
it is also essential that we maintain the second pillar of the common agricultural policy .
mr president , I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report .
the future of farming and the cap must provide farmers with a viable secure income .
pillar one payments must continue giving farmers a direct payment which gives them a minimum level of income security .
the distribution of cap funds must take into consideration the cost of production in member states .
this is a good thing .
the primary function of agriculture is and remains the production of food for our citizens .
farmers are required to produce more and more with less and less .
this is impossible without increasing efficiency .
the european parliament , the commission and the council are responsible for securing the necessary framework conditions for this .
everything else is very worthy , very desirable , but secondary .
we must face up to this problem and solve it .
we cannot continue with such great differences in the long term .
solving this problem is going to be difficult .
i would like to thank mr smith , who has noticed the problem with the budget .
it is necessary to amend the cap to help those who need it urgently .
currently the largest proportion goes to big owners and to producers .
a proper budget for the cap is also important , and I express my thanks to mr lyon .
these systems can operate and become widespread throughout the european union .
the commission must commit itself to defining a budget that is sufficient to achieve these objectives .
what is more , at this time of crisis , many young people want to return to farming .
i believe that the commission must take a supportive and flexible approach to helping young farmers .
the president cut off the speaker 
i wish to stress in particular the articles referring to the common agricultural policy's architecture .
the cap must continue to be based on its two pillars .
another key point is to maintain a cap budget at least at its current level .
however , farmers need support to be able to comply with these standards .
a well structured , properly financed common agricultural policy means safe , good quality food for europeans .
mr president , I too wish to thank my colleague george lyon for his excellent work on this report .
the common agricultural policy must remain a common european policy .
secondly transparency and proportionality should be central to the future cap .
lastly , european farmers produce food to the highest quality and standards .
we also need to ensure a level playing field , fair competition and the future viability of european agriculture .
bulgarians and romanians will receive a mere 40 % .
at the same time , all are operating in the common market of the european union .
i firmly believe that this injustice must be eliminated as soon as possible .
all farmers throughout the union must have an equal position and the same conditions for subsidies .
in the 1970s , nearly 70 % of the eu budget was spent on agriculture .
unfortunately , today the revised cap is being designed under the same conditions of competitiveness as the previous policy .
it is insulting that the economic crisis is being used as a pretext to cut benefits to farmers .
moreover , it is the latter who are to blame for today's conditions of crisis .
mr president , I declare an interest as a working farmer .
plans for the future of the cap have to work at a practical level and it must be affordable .
if there has to be a cap , let it assist farmers and not hinder them .
fr mr president , I understand that you had a short and happy night .
what is the aim here ?
that is the aim .
what do we mean by that ?
rejecting the renationalisation of the cap and increasing cofinancing , that is the first point .
the fourth element is regulating and preventing market volatility , which I believe is essential .
we must return to this topic and we need to go a little further still .
my final point concerns the first and the second pillar .
i am saying that this morning because this is the debate we are holding .
commissioner , I would like to finish with a simple idea .
the cap was created at the same time as the european economic community .
we are now in the european union .
i really feel that we ought to have a major policy .
the president cut off the speaker 
finally , it needs to deliver value for money .
to my mind , that means we should ensure that funds are used effectively .
the rapporteur has produced an excellent report .
i congratulate him on his work and am happy to support .
farmers will be paid per hectare for water conservation , reforestation and so forth .
choice without an alternative is no choice at all .
wales has a strong history of agriculture and many communities depend heavily upon farming .
its market orientation will continue as at present .
we need a proper safety net .
commissioner , our farmers will once more have to make efforts to adapt .
any changes that do take place must be accompanied by realistic transition periods .
i would like to thank mr lyon and all of the shadow rapporteurs for their work .
as you know , the rules of procedure make provision for five to speak .
in accepting new challenges , the common agricultural policy must maintain its care for environmental values and food security .
in addition , I propose leaving tried and tested instruments for market regulation untouched .
milk quotas are an example .
if they are ended , what will we replace them with ?
of course , there are certain ideas , but we do not have any certainty .
the president cut off the speaker 
the president cut off the speaker 
the evidence is that , today , europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials .
furthermore , today we have a cap that must be reformed for three reasons .
it is a cap that is unfair , economically , socially and environmentally .
socially aid is unfairly distributed between countries , regions and farmers .
eighty per cent of aid is allocated to 20 % of farmers .
environmentally we need a cap which respects the soil , which respects .
the president cut off the speaker 
that therefore means that the cap requires thorough reform and such reform requires starting from scratch .
yet our farmers are not always rewarded by the market for these contributions to the public good .
we therefore need support where the market fails .
the fact that the report calls for aid per hectare is a positive thing .
this will counteract further intensification of agriculture and make the achievement of environmental targets a more realistic prospect .
that is how we can reward our farmers .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , agricultural policy needs a coherent framework .
this must strengthen the eu as a whole , while also taking regional differences into account .
there are some enormous challenges facing agricultural policy .
i would therefore welcome a clear signal on that from the commissioner as soon as possible .
new public mechanisms for regulating agricultural production will have to be established to ensure the food security of consumers .
we are in favour of a strong cap that has the budget it needs to achieve its objectives .
the president cut off the speaker 
the president cut off the speaker 
the president cut off the speaker 
i have two requests to speak in relation to observance of the rules of procedure .
mrs mcguinness has the floor first .
i will put in a written statement on this issue .
i hope you support my point , colleagues .
those are the rules of procedure .
moreover , it is stipulated that five shall speak , although we have given 10 the floor .
this is a very important issue .
now mr obermayr has the floor , also in relation to observance of the rules of procedure .
de mr president , I assume you were referring to me .
of course I would like to thank you for your generosity in allowing ten speakers rather than five .
we understand your time constraints , naturally , but I hope you will understand us too .
this is a very important issue .
there are parts of europe that are operating under a considerable burden and that are under extreme threat .
naturally this is also true beyond the work of the committees .
secondly , you indicated that the problem regarding thecatch the eyeprocedure has not been resolved .
it would be helpful and fair to put the appropriate structures in place as soon as possible .
i beg your indulgence and thank you again for your understanding .
you are absolutely right .
however , there are members here who are constantly getting the blue card out .
however , I do not wish to prolong the debate .
i therefore feel that we need a realistic budget .
what we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our farmers .
we must reflect on how agriculture and the agri food sector can contribute to this .
i also want to send out a clear message and to answer mr kelly's question about direct aid .
therefore , in my opinion , historic references do not constitute fair , transparent or objective criteria .
to conclude , I would like to reaffirm that we need a common agricultural policy for europe .
a new strategic importance for food production and the cap absolutely .
two pillars absolutely , I agree with that .
food production at the heart of the cap yes , that is absolutely what the cap is about .
it needs to be objective and transparent as to how money is allocated between member states .
they need to meet the challenges of the europe 2020 strategy .
applause 
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place today , thursday 8 july 2010 , at 12.00 .
as mrs mcguinness says , they may present their contribution in writing .
an effort needs to be made towards rigour , but it needs to be made by all of us .
written statements rule 149 
adapting the cap to the new social and economic realities is a necessary step .
we actually need to answer some key questions to be able to do this .
i totally concur with the need to guarantee security of food supply .
until now , the cap has kept prices high for foods which are cheaper in other countries .
the eu cannot promote free trade while protecting its own agricultural market .
however , I am concerned most about the impact which the cap reforms have had on farmers .
decoupling is necessary to avoid overproduction .
we need incentives for farmers , especially to encourage young people to move to rural areas .
however , this is not going to happen while maintaining the current direct payments system , which is ridiculous .
above all , the eu needs to retain the trust of european farmers .
europe will still need an effective and common agricultural policy after 20this is why the eu's agricultural budget should at least be maintained at the current level .
europe has a particular responsibility to guarantee food safety in the world .
therefore , the main task of the cap is to preserve the agricultural production capacity of the european union .
it is therefore vital to ensure that direct payments do not decrease .
these would reduce farmerslosses arising from price fluctuations .
the european food trade is much more concentrated than the food processing industry or agricultural production .
this is why we must help improve cooperation between farmers .
however , this requires an exemption from the stringent eu competition rules in agriculture .
i would like to thank all those involved for the work they have done .
forward looking targets have been formulated for the entire community .
the tried and tested two pillar structure must be retained with a strong first pillar and an equally strong second pillar .
the major fluctuations in the liberalised markets and the effects of climate change continue to necessitate a safety net .
we thus provide for the possibility of a transitional period .
such a period is essential , but a full seven years would be an excessively long transitional period .
undistorted competition in europe is also a precondition for the competitiveness of european farmers in world markets .
the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013 is extremely important for us .
the entire european parliament needs to be aware of the cap's significance for the future of the eu .
today , differences between the level of payments in different member states are too great .
this undermines the sense of solidarity , equality and community .
what farmers need most of all is stable incomes , both now and in the longer term .
thank you very much .
the report is firm on keeping the policy an eu one , rejecting attempts to re nationalise it .
to begin with I want to thank my colleague mr lyon for drafting a very balanced report .
i believe that this has already allowed us to create a good basis for discussion for the near future .
changing agricultural policy is perhaps one of the biggest tasks of this plenary session .
the report is a good basis for further discussions .
thank you for your attention .
in writing . de I thank the rapporteur .
our primary goal must be to ensure high quality food production in europe .
in the discussion on the organisation of agrarian reform , there was frequent talk of compensation of public goods .
in my opinion , this debate goes in the right direction .
the development of rural areas plays an ever greater role .
however , the european union recently gained 12 new member states .
however , this can only be achieved if the resources dedicated to agricultural policy are not reduced after 20i believe that only a major reform can save the common agricultural policy .
direct payments significantly affect the security of food supplies .
the next item is the debate on 
i was one of the authors of the first oral question .
i am not at all happy that we now have a joint debate with two questions merging .
i have tried since may to get the mercosur question on the agenda .
i do not know how this happened or why this happened .
i am extremely unhappy about it .
can I come back to this in the debate ?
i would like a clarification please , and I hope other colleagues will support me .
clearly there was not enough time this morning .
you saw the demand and you saw the problem .
can we get this parliament to work for the members of parliament , not for the administration of parliament ?
the president cut off the speaker 
it is not the administration that organises debates .
the administration helps the political bodies organise debates .
author . mr president , it is not because it is summertime and we are all cross .
it is just because we make very valid points and we take our jobs seriously .
i am going to take 30 seconds because I have two blank pages .
i have asked five questions of the commission .
i do not intend to speak before I hear the answers .
i will return at the end of the debate .
thank you very much , mrs mcguinness .
i will grant you later the time that you have not used now .
by the same token , ear tagging rules were not enforced .
these are only some examples of the many I could list from the fao report last october .
indeed , it will have entirely the opposite effect .
we cannot accept this .
europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle .
these imports from brazil and argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectares .
they are concentrated in the hands of three enterprises cargill , adm and bunch .
between 2001 and 2004 soya destroyed more than 1.2 million hectares of tropical and equatorial forest .
it is one of the principal causes of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity .
this decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change .
these efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement .
these concessions will not serve the interests of the farming families of mercosur , only those of agro industrial groups .
many poultry farmers , particularly in brittany , paid the price for that deal .
europe seems to want to pursue its policy of relocation by intensifying its attacks against farmers .
we must stop this insane process by offering our citizens quality , locally produced food .
author . mr president , I will try and be brief .
there are real concerns about the reopening of the negotiations with mercosur .
i represent scotland , which has extensive beef production .
secondly , what negotiating mandate will the negotiators have in terms of agricultural products ?
can someone please tell me what they are being allowed to negotiate on ?
how many tonnes of beef ?
how much access ?
is there no tariff , or are there minimum tariffs ?
can someone please tell us what the mandate is ?
two other points .
the two are completely linked and therefore we need to understand what the impact will be .
finally , what involvement does the agriculture commissioner have on this issue ?
will this parliament be consulted before any final agreement is reached ?
i would like to hear some answers to these questions .
we share a common history and social values with them .
the deepening of political and cultural ties and maximising mutual benefits in economic terms therefore makes perfect sense .
agriculture is only one part of this macro agreement .
fears therefore need to be faced in terms of their proper proportions and justification .
i am thus happy to respond in any format decided by the chair .
in economic terms , a successful agreement could bring considerable benefits to both the eu and mercosur .
it is an increasingly important partner for the eu .
in terms of foreign direct investments , mercosur is also a key partner .
the commission has taken this decision after a thorough examination and in depth internal debate .
this was a proper decision of the college , and parliament was extensively informed immediately afterwards .
that is something quite different .
the first meeting with mercosur took place last week in buenos aires .
we will of course keep the european parliament and the council fully informed about the evolution of the negotiations .
this applies to all areas to be covered by the agreement , including agriculture .
in this context , we are aware that accompanying measures might become necessary for the most sensitive sectors .
it is , however , way too early to discuss what these measures could cover .
we are only just starting the negotiations and have not yet entered into discussions on substance .
it is not the trade commissioner who decides what agricultural offers will be put on the table .
that is the way it happens , so mr dacian cioloş is fully included in these discussions .
i believe that if we make the right choices it is possible to successfully conclude both negotiations .
as regards food safety , it goes without saying that imports have to fully respect eu food safety requirements .
the eu approach in all trade negotiations is certainly not to decrease the eu level of protection .
now let me turn to the eu brazil summit and start with a short overview of our relations .
moreover , brazil often acts as an informal bridge between western and emerging and developing countries .
brazil is one of nine countries with which the eu has entered into a strategic partnership .
the moment for such an assessment is particularly appropriate as president lula's term in office approaches its end .
at the summit we will confirm our commitment to strengthening non proliferation and encourage closer cooperation .
brazil opposed the iran sanctions adopted last june by the un security council .
the summit will also address regional issues cuba , honduras , paraguay and venezuela .
lastly , tough work is still being finalised on some issues where we expect the summit to deliver .
first , the signature of a horizontal civil aviation agreement and an air safety agreement .
second , the announcement of a joint work programme on triangular cooperation with developing countries .
i will try to give additional examples in response to your questions .
a brief digression commissioner , negotiations with the countries of the andes and central america have been completed .
do the agreements include a net exporter clause , in order to prevent the development of a trade triangle ?
can the commission assure us that import prices will be maintained in the fruit and vegetable sector ?
brazil was the only bric country with which europe had no strategic partnership .
beef imports will increase by 70 % , poultry imports by 25 % .
commissioner , I would therefore like to voice my concern to you .
our agriculture is in great difficulty .
destabilising it further will have serious consequences .
we cannot develop european trade policy without taking account of and defending one of our main assets .
the commission must hear this message and this demand .
my group and I share these concerns .
that is why an impact assessment is absolutely essential .
clearly there is a lack of consistency here .
nor must we lose sight of the misgivings of the agricultural sector in relation to cheap meat imports .
es mr president , we are all pleased about the freeing of political prisoners in cuba .
with regard to the subject of mercosur , there are several clarifications that need to be made .
i do not understand why certain sectors or interest groups should come out of this negotiation at a disadvantage .
it will depend on the firmness of our negotiators .
disastrous knock on effects might also follow for other sectors , such as the pork sector for example .
commissioner , I would ask you to be particularly vigilant in this regard .
this is not scaremongering .
european farmers are operating under strict health and safety criteria .
they adhere to all standards set for them and they guarantee high quality , safe produce for consumers .
i agree that we must improve the coordination of all of these topics within the european parliament .
i should like to emphasise one point in particular .
i am actually grateful that the commission has reopened negotiations .
on 5 may of this year , this house supported the reopening of negotiations in the salafranca report .
in other words , the commission is doing exactly what parliament decided by a large majority .
nonetheless , I would argue that we do not want an agreement at any price .
naturally the interests of agriculture , industry and the service sector must be taken into account as a whole .
however , commissioner , this trade with the mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one way street .
the frequent claims made in public that europe is closing itself off in the agricultural markets are quite wrong .
we purchase over 90 % of african agricultural exports and 45 % of central and south american agricultural exports .
europe is certainly not closed off to external trade .
what I would criticise , commissioner , is the information policy pursued .
it has not been good .
as an agricultural policymaker , I first learned that these negotiations had begun when I opened the newspapers .
in future we should not have to rely on the press for our information .
i urge you to inform the agricultural sector represented here in parliament about the progress of negotiations .
last year , parliament passed the most stringent plant protection product legislation in the world .
many active ingredients are prohibited in europe .
consumer protection is inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiations .
you are not telling the truth !
this is the truth , mr de gucht .
this is the other reason for my question .
incidentally , I would add that the new member states can only lose out here .
they should sort it out themselves .
there is no need to provide an eu framework for this .
hu the european commission defined the negotiating mandates some 11 years ago .
the world has changed over the past 11 years .
the european commission has disregarded these developments .
it has not requested a new mandate .
without a proper mandate , we can only reach unacceptable agreements .
go back to the drawing board .
the last speaker addressed some of the points that I would wish to make .
contrast that to the delight , or rather to the fear and trepidation and anger , among eu producers .
this parliament imposes high standards of food production on our producers .
we have failed to defend them in the past .
there is no consistency between agriculture and trade policy .
this parliament has to insist that there will be .
that is precisely the issue being discussed behind the scenes at the negotiations with mercosur .
where , I ask , is the consistency ?
already we are talking about possible concessions on agriculture , and I would like you to clarify this .
in your response you spoke about forthcoming summits on climate change .
i come from ireland , and we export 90 % of our beef .
recent research has shown that brazilian emissions are between three and eight times higher than the irish equivalent .
will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assessments ?
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the spanish presidency has decided to sign this agreement .
i therefore call on the commission to adopt an authoritative position so as to safeguard european quality production .
sacrificing agriculture for gains in other areas is simply unacceptable .
the beef industry in the united kingdom is currently experiencing a fall in farm gate prices .
how is europe going to provide for these people ?
a commission that claims to act in the best interests of the citizens must do so .
we must end these talks and look after our farmers .
pl negotiations with the mercosur countries were suspended in 200however , we should also be protecting the interests of our farmers and the agriculture and food sector .
if that happened , it would be necessary to propose certain forms of compensation to farmers .
experts estimate that making such an agreement could result in very large losses of income among farmers .
these will be even higher if the agreement is both bilateral and made at wto level .
however , when I consider our agricultural production and the products themselves , not everything can be proven scientifically .
in europe we have some excellent legislation in relation to the future of biodiversity .
the politicians must be able to decide , even when the scientific evidence is unavailable .
we do not want cloned meat from the mercosur countries .
you understood that we feel that the mandate is no longer valid .
i would also like to draw your attention to the political aspects of mercosur .
in trade , the key element is confidence .
mercosur was almost dissolved at the 2007 summit .
the countries do not agree on accessions .
venezuela almost did not accede .
how can we negotiate in such a politically unstable area ?
first check the political stability of mercosur and then we will conclude trade agreements .
de mr president , I believe that we have talked a great deal about sustainability .
i think this is an outrage .
please tell us when you are going to ignore people .
colleagues , by way of explanation , I have about 18 people on the list .
today I took eight speakers .
so I think I have done the maximum I could have done .
first of all on the mandate .
several members criticised the fact that we are working on the basis of a mandate going back to 199this applies to all areas to be covered by the agreement , including agriculture.
that is still true .
that is still what we have to do , so nothing much has to be added to this mandate .
in the mean time , we have the problem of climate change and the world has changed since then .
yes , we have noticed that too , and we will take this into consideration in the negotiations .
that is not the reason to change the mandate .
there was another member who said that council should be here and that council should instruct us .
the council does not have to instruct us .
we are not instructed by the council .
we will stick to that .
i am ready to discuss at length any of the elements .
i have done so with the inta committee and I am ready to go back to the inta committee .
a letter was sent by the director general for trade to his argentinean counterpart on 12 may .
our message was very strong and very clear .
we will insist that we have this meeting as soon as possible .
on sugar 
similar quotas are provided for within the framework of the negotiations with central america .
the colombian , peruvian and central american aggregated quantities account for less than 2 % of european consumption .
as for plant health , environmental and other measures .
but those are not the ones that we can impose on other countries .
i presume that this is not the last time we will discuss mercosur in this plenary .
commissioner , I am also sure that this will not be the last time we do so .
the joint debate is closed .
reopening negotiations with the mercosur countries without consulting the member states was very dirty play .
otherwise , the costs of concessions under the wto will be borne by our farmers .
in writing . these mercosour talks represent a potentially dreadful development for the future of european agriculture .
i have to say that the commission's attitude to the matter has been appalling .
this attitude , I find , is appalling .
it is heartening to see so many agricultural meps here from all the groups supporting the protection of agriculture .
it seems that the mercosur negotiations are only pursuing one goal to hand over a defenceless european agriculture .
the sensitive agricultural sector must not be handed over in the negotiations .
feel free to sell your grandmother , commissioner , but do not give away our european agriculture .
two commissioners for one report , what an honour !
imports of fishery and aquaculture products from third countries account for more than 60 % of eu consumption .
ladies and gentlemen , the survival of european fisheries is non negotiable .
in essence , we are demanding the following .
this will mean that better account is taken of the specific characteristics of fishery and aquaculture products .
i think this is the perfect time to review the terms of this fundamental debate .
indeed , we are on the eve of an important reform of the cfp .
we have a fisheries sector that is neither ecologically sustainable nor economically performing well .
so here we need an answer .
i strongly support your call for an increased coherence of our policies .
we need to work together with a global and integrated vision .
with reference to wto negotiations , we are paying particular attention to the ongoing discussions on subsidies .
this brings us to labelling .
consumers want to know more about the seafood they buy .
the commission is ready to work on legislative initiatives aiming at giving consumers the information they need .
finally , a word on aquaculture .
this sensitivity is taken into consideration in the implementation of the common commercial policy .
i will be very honest with you on this point .
we therefore actively defend much stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products .
however , we must be clear .
for these reasons my group will obviously vote in favour of the report .
moreover , I would like to congratulate mr cadec on the excellent work that he has done .
they enter the european market at a price that is uneconomic for european producers .
europe's own catches have diminished at an alarming rate by 26 % since 1997 alone .
this should not need to be the case .
the cadec report mentions several important instruments that the eu can use .
the first is the iuu regulation .
that is a first step , but it does not go far enough .
the second instrument is already in place in the united nations .
we have good international agreements , but we also need to implement them .
we must continue to pursue this .
mr president , commissioners , first of all I want to thank the rapporteur for his report .
the value of nethrops or langoustines sold by my fishermen in northern ireland to other parts of europe plummeted .
this at the same time as imports of shellfish and fish have become increasingly available .
europe needs fish .
we need fish imports , but I would contend that these should not come at any cost .
on the one hand , my colleagues want to stop our fishermen receiving any subsidy .
europe cannot have it both ways .
is it your responsibility to prevent this ?
it would not happen in any other parliament in the world .
applause 
mr gallagher , we have to carry on .
de mr president , mrs damanaki , european fisheries policy is facing enormous challenges .
doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen .
the best way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover .
another way to enable european fisheries to survive would be through better marketing .
i would also like to thank him for his excellent cooperation .
there are major challenges involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the eu .
this market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries .
we have now submitted two amendments in plenary .
these relate to the need for us to recognise the special economic situation in the peripheral regions of europe .
however , we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for the difficulties .
the president cut off the speaker 
without being protectionist , the line defended here may be described as less naïve .
that is why I favour a european label , in accordance with our standards , both environmental and social .
we were told originally that there would be votes at 12.00 .
this has moved by five minutes every five minutes .
people have planes to catch it is inconvenient it makes a mockery of parliament .
someone get a grip !
applause 
i am sure that we will be able to vote at 12.i would like to say that we are taking care of all the concerns mentioned by the members .
as mr de gucht and I have already mentioned , we are trying to find a balance .
we need a viable fisheries sector and we have some obligations to the wto and other international bodies .
what you are doing here is scandalous .
you make me feel ashamed .
all you are worried about is voting and going home .
i will finish my speech by thanking you in advance for your vote .

pl I endorsed the alvaro report .
in order to be effective , we must have workable instruments for fighting terrorism .
one very important preventative tool involves monitoring and reducing the financial resources which reach and belong to terrorists .
very often , in fact , money is the fuel for terrorist activities .
fi mr president , I voted in favour of this report by mr alvaro .
in this respect it needs to be very clear .
mr president , there is always a delicate balance to be drawn between civil liberties and security .
several times since the twin tower attacks nine years ago I think we have got that balance wrong .
this chamber has made that mistake , but it has not been alone .
national parliaments have done the same thing on both sides of the atlantic .
on this occasion , though , I believe we have got the balance right .
ga mr president , I voted against the report on the european external action service .
mr president , I supported elmar brok's report .
the united position of the european parliament has taken maximum advantage of the new opportunities the lisbon treaty offers .
i support especially the european parliament's political and financial supervision of the european external action service .
this process has only begun .
mr president , I voted against this report .
those of us who opposed the creation of the eeas out of principle in 2008 still oppose it .
otherwise , I voted in line with my group's position on the matter .
lv thank you , mr president .
the european external action service will represent the common position of the whole european union .
this practice must become the priority of european union foreign policy .
adequate geographical representation must be an unambiguous fundamental principle in the formation of the service .
thank you .
i want to draw attention to some important problems which we should take into account .
secondly , the eu diplomatic service should reflect the character of the union .
responsibility for important regulatory , supervisory and budgetary functions rests with the european parliament .
thirdly , the unclear situation concerning who has control of the eeas is causing great concern .
this may lead to the establishment of another union institution .
the eeas should build on the values and identity of the european union .
the president cut off the speaker 
despite that , I do have a few questions and concerns regarding this new service .
obviously , the high representative needs resources .
in this way we could ensure that the service operated in a more equitable fashion .
human rights have to be her top concern .
the european union's diplomatic corps has already squeezed out the national services .
what is it doing ?
i think we could just about manage to do better .
we are the fourth largest military power on the planet and the fifth largest economy .
i think we can run our own foreign policy to suit our own interests !
de mr president , I voted against the brok report for four reasons .
the architecture of the service has numerous weaknesses , the details of which still cause us great concern .
that exposes these funds to numerous risks , and the safeguards against these risks are still extremely unclear .
the third point is the relinquishment of the rights of this parliament in a council regulation .
the fourth point is the question of how we actually treat each other in parliament .
unfortunately , I did not have any option other than to vote against this text .
however , I am from a country which has not recognised kosovo's independence .
i regret that the position of states which do not recognise kosovo's independence was not given greater consideration .
mr president , I voted in favour of the resolution .
kosovo can be considered the last piece in the complex balkan political puzzle .
the independence of kosovo has already been recognised by 69 countries , including 22 eu member states .
that is a crucial point .
most member states have now done this .
i was an early supporter of kosovan independence .
there is a conflict between supranationalism and democracy .
we should recognise it .
albania is certainly a country which has made tangible progress in the context of the reform process .
the political crisis following the june 2009 parliamentary elections is deplorable .
de mr president , the ex communist socialists in albania are trying to destabilise the successful government there .
this was not the case , and I also said this to mr füle yesterday .
an eu commissioner must not be abused for the purpose of socialist propaganda and for internal political ends .
the macedonian government has democratic legitimacy .
it does first class work and it is putting the country on the path towards european union membership .
aid to kyrgyzstan should be targeted at people and not at a specific government .
uzbekistan has a different opinion in this question .
as the report indicates , several human rights activists have been arrested without due cause in kyrgyzstan .
these facts must be borne in mind when evaluating european union strategy towards the existing political power in kyrgyzstan .
those countries also have significant influence in this region .
that is why I support this report , since this investigation is desperately necessary .
thank you .
it states that in 2008 alone , 2.7 million more people were infected .
the eu has invested billions of euros and the number of people infected is increasing .
has it already been 30 years ?
a policy of sexual and reproductive rights will not help africa .
de mr president , the common agricultural policy is a success story .
of course , there are new and future tasks .
these include green growth , renewable energies and combating world hunger .
we must now work together to provide suitable financial resources for these political tasks .
europe has a duty to guarantee food security for its citizens .
europe must guarantee a suitable livelihood for rural communities .
we must produce and maintain a healthy environment here .
our farmers need a fair wage .
pl I endorsed this report .
this is not inconsistent with free market principles .
the number of young farmers continues to fall , while we have increasing numbers of older farmers .
farmers have held protests about this .
in summary , we should aim for the sustainable development of agriculture and rural areas .
lv thank you , mr president .
it stresses that financing for the policy must be preserved for at least the next long term financial period .
secondly , it requires that direct payments to farmers be fully financed from the european union budget .
these destructive discrepancies distort competition and the whole european union market .
fi mr president , I have to say that I voted in favour of the lyon report .
on a few points I had what I might call national reservations , or I voted a bit differently .
that is why I introduced a few derogations when I voted .
every member state needs its own agriculture and has to ensure that it is preserved .
mr president , I voted against the lyon report because all over europe governments are cutting their budgets .
in the united kingdom nurses and teachers face cuts in their pay and pensions .
police numbers are being cut and prisoners are being released because we cannot afford to keep them in prison .
i find that entirely unacceptable .
the government in the uk and governments across europe are saying we are all in this together .
if we are in it together , we all have to feel the pain together .
scrapping the cap would allow efficient farmers to thrive .
reform is not enough it is time to scrap the cap .
they are needed to guarantee the food supply as well as sustainable development .
the first one is of an environmental , social and qualitative nature .
the second aspect is an economic one .
lv thank you .
for this reason , I supported this report , which calls for the current situation to be changed .
and finally , we must do much more to promote aquaculture .
that would greatly help to solve this problem .
mr president , I would like to thank you and all your staff for all your patience .
surely it is time to learn from the lessons of successful fish preservation and conservation .
written explanations of vote
noterror agreementrespects grassroots freedoms .
today , the terms of this agreement have been considerably improved , in the interest of european citizens .
the agreement is a significant step forward compared to the previous version .
given the highly sensitive nature of the personal data transferred , I could not vote for this agreement .
the agreement states that europe will develop its own system for the collection and sorting of bank details .
that will offer the opportunity to individualise transfers .
from that moment on , the issue of reciprocity will become relevant .
europol will be charged with the task of verifying and approving us requests .
the new agreement strikes a balance between protecting privacy and guaranteeing security .
in the meantime , the fight against terrorism will remain our overriding concern .
while this agreement is satisfactory , certain points could still have been improved .
confidential and private financial data belongs to the individual and not to the eu or the european parliament .
this is a matter for national governments to decide , and not for the european parliament .
this new agreement is better than the previous one .
this agreement , however , continues to allow the mass transfer of data bulk data .
the choice of europol is wrong .
europol is neither a judicial authority nor a data protection authority .
in writing . pt the fight against terrorism must be a priority for the european union .
i am therefore voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report .
thanks to the action of mps and of our group in particular , a new version was drawn up .
it contains significant underlying improvements , such as the elimination ofbulkdata transfers .
that is why I chose to vote in favour of the new agreement .
a few months ago the first version of the agreement was too vague and did not offer similar guarantees .
that is why we saidno.
the commission should carry out this task in an assiduous and timely fashion .
articles 15 and 16 ensure that citizens have strengthened access to redress and increased transparency .
the new version is an improvement on the last one .
it is unfortunate that the majority in parliament have now voted in favour of this agreement .
we rather support a more secure society with broad democratic rights and freedoms .
combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate data protection .
these are serious infringements of fundamental rights .
however , the european union is not permitted to unduly curtail existing fundamental rights .
i therefore still reject this swift agreement .
today , after careful consideration , I voted in favour of the revised swift agreement .
this new version also brings improvements , in particular as regards the purpose of data transfer .
in view of the importance of data protection , the spd delegation did not make its decision lightly .
for us , the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk data .
sepa data are not covered by the agreement most transfers are not affected at all .
the new agreement is a victory for all the european institutions , and for our european parliament in particular .
i voted against this report .
it is tantamount to approval of united states interference in europe with the complicity of bodies such as swift .
this report and the agreement that it ratifies are a symbol of this europe's enslavement by american imperialism .
all mechanisms that help to discover possible attacks are fundamental to this fight's success .
the project for solution approved today is a good starting point for the difficult negotiations ahead with the us .
in writing . de data protection with the swift agreement is simply a sham .
i voted in favour of the alvaro report because I consider it important to combat terrorism .
terrorism is a threat and as such must be combated .
the re hashed swift agreement does very little to change this situation .
citizens would first have to cope with the cost of instituting legal proceedings in the united states !
what was first celebrated as a success for the european parliament in february has now become a washout .
even the rapporteur admits that he is not totally satisfied .
it does not provide any real , effective data protection and should therefore be rejected .
the agreement also marks a new phase in parliament's powers , ensuring european democratic oversight of international agreements .
this commitment will in the mid term ensure the termination of bulk data transfers to the us authorities .
i voted in favour of the new swift agreement at today's plenary of the european parliament .
this is a very important agreement which aims to stamp out terrorism and organised crime by combating illegal financing .
it is important that this new agreement also safeguards respect for the personal data of european citizens .
the new agreement refers to the need to create a european tftp terrorist finance tracking program .
this is a commitment which needs to be implemented within five years .
this is not the case here .
the present agreement enables the transfer of banking data , but introduces proper security and privacy safeguards .
a real change towards binding fundamental rights protection in the fight against terrorism requires greater courage and effort .
terrorist acts must be prevented and every terrorist act must be condemned in the strongest possible terms .
on the other hand , there is the protection of citizensrights .
citizensrights are not a foregone conclusion we have fought for them .
it is a tool of the nato strategy and wars .
it will be a tool for applying the precedence of community law over the national laws of the states .
this compromise was the subject of extensive negotiations and it currently seems satisfactory and balanced to me .
it allows the european parliament to reinforce its prerogatives and preserve the community method .
in addition , the latter's budget will be subject to political control from parliament .
my country has shown its commitment to european crisis management missions .
the european external action service eeas represents considerable progress in this respect .
the european interest of the initial draft has been retained .
i am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the eeas will respect this balance .
will the member states no longer be free to define their own foreign policy ?
it is not acceptable to a sovereign nation for a european organisation to scrutinise its foreign service .
it is not the business of the ep to do so .
a common foreign policy and a common economic policy are the necessary objectives of the european integration process .
in writing . I welcome the brok report as amended .
it was essential to resist the proposal to subsume development policy as part of our foreign policy .
we need an autonomous development service answerable to an autonomous commissioner for development and humanitarian aid .
we need ensure the implementation is pursued in accordance with the spirit and letter of the agreement .
there remain elements of the proposal that could give rise to different interpretations .
the rules and practice governing languages in this service will reveal the extent of its commitment to external communication .
the same thing has happened with regard to the eu intelligence structures .
we , as members of a european parliament strengthened by the treaty , can help with this .
what has parliament managed to win in the negotiations with the high representative ?
furthermore , it will have the effect of strengthening the european parliament's political and budgetary control powers .
i sincerely hope that best use will be made of this service in the interests of the european union .
the latter will thus demonstrate genuine political coherence and will speak with one voice on the international stage .
it can only emerge greater from this , and its actions will be more legitimate and effective .
the proposal made by baroness ashton is unacceptable .
i shall vote against this text .
today's vote lays the foundations for a strong diplomatic service at european union level .
moreover , at least 60 % of the staff of this new service will be eu officials .
this report will ensure geographical balance as well as better coherence between the different aspects of the eeas .
it is not about duplicating diplomatic services within the eu , but about strengthening the eu's diplomatic services .
this is a chance for the european union but also for its member states .
timely coordination of the different areas of eu external policy by the commission is clearly important .
this includes , in particular , the footnotes that were adopted in the text today .
a better service could have been possible , though .
we support the compromise because parliament managed to improve ms ashton's original proposal considerably .
the deal is not flawless , however .
they must work together , create a common esprit de corps and overcome divisive competition .
in any case , these costs should be within sensible and comprehensible limits .
in this regard , we must utilise synergies in order to achieve maximum quality and cost savings .
kosovo is part of a very sensitive geographical zone , on which the eu should maintain constant focus .
it is without hesitation that I support this resolution , which addresses these important issues .
the resolution also calls for an even stronger presence of eulex in kosovo .
in writing . pt I voted against this resolution .
in writing . pt kosovo has still not received unanimous recognition by the member states .
kosovo still has a long way to go .
for these reasons , I cannot support mrs lunacek's motion for a resolution .
it has therefore had no real impact on the situation in the country so far .
the rampant , widespread corruption and the smuggling of weapons and drugs sow unrest in the region .
it is strange that the currency in this territory is the euro .
particularly as the basic preconditions for using the common european currency have not even superficially been met .
this attack took place four days after the explosion in mitrovica during a serb demonstration .
the eu basically needs to deal with the process of establishing democracy and reinforcing stability in kosovo .
five eu member states , including france , have not recognised kosovo's independence .
consequently , it is unacceptable to present a report today that advocates the integration of kosovo into the eu .
i shall vote against this unacceptable and provocative text .
this is a signal of encouragement for the government as well as the citizens of kosovo .
with this resolution , parliament is in favour of starting talks on visa liberalisation as soon as possible .
that is why it will need all our support .
the union should continue its strategy of expansion in a gradual and strict manner .
nevertheless , everyone knows that the road to joining the union is a demanding one .
the conditions governing entry to the eu are clear and well known , and not always easy to fulfil .
i hope that albania proceeds along its way towards the union in a determined and unhesitating manner .
it is out of friendship for the albanians that I voted against this text .
i voted against this text .
it encourages the development and use of renewable energy , public transport and environmental legislation .
this matter is entirely up to the albanian people themselves .
one of these measures is to promote people to people contacts through academic exchanges between pupils , students and scientists .
we should , in principle , support visa exemption for the countries of the western balkans .
however , the prerequisite for this is that all the conditions laid down are fully met .
i voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution drafted by various political groups .
instruments should therefore be introduced to help re establish security in kyrgyzstan .
we must not let ourselves be deceived .
abortion in the world is a real tragedy , but it is a real tragedy in our europe too !
nevertheless , I do not agree with associating the fight against hiv with a sensitive issue like abortion .
the resolution also requires governments to fulfil their obligation to make a public health service available to all citizens .
in order to stop the disease , much research is being carried out , also within the eu .
since research in the area of hiv / aids is essential , I voted for the resolution .
as an advocate of the right to life , I could not in good conscience vote in favour .
nevertheless , I would reiterate my total commitment to the fight against hiv / aids .
it also shows that the ppe group is divided on the issue .
it is not a problem , today , of drug addicts or homosexuals , but of everyone .
almost half of those living with hiv are women .
women must have universal and easy access to information on health aspects of sex , reproduction and medical services .
school education programmes on sexual and reproductive rights are crucial for hiv / aids prevention .
for these reasons the ecr group has decided to abstain on this resolution .
this convention needs to be applied immediately by all states .
parliament's support for their prohibition and eradication is fully justified .
regrettably , children are the main victims of this type of explosive material .
our motion for a resolution is balanced .
farmers also provide food , which we need in order to live .
the report considers the painful consequences for small and medium sized farms to be a success .
they generate more than eur 337 billion in production annually at eu level .
several amendments have been tabled in the plenary part session .
in writing . lt I voted for this report .
the new cap will have to adapt to a changing european and global context and withstand many challenges .
european agriculture must ensure food security to its own consumers and contribute to feeding a steadily growing world population .
agriculture is important to our citizens .
however , a firm policy will need to be backed up by sufficient financial means .
there are challenges that we have already mentioned and there will be new ones to contend with .
the union now consists of a great number of member states .
i endorse this report because it calls for comparable funds to be appropriated for agriculture in the post 2013 budget .
that said , some reformulation will be necessary .
first of all , we need simplified arrangements and less red tape .
a transition period where we proceed with caution will be of major importance in this respect .
this report gives agricultural policy a strategic role in terms of food security and sustainable development .
the report also deals with the links between agricultural policy and fighting climate change .
this was not included in the report .
this was not included in the report .
this was not included in the report either .
amendment 3 we danish social democrats believe that eu subsidies should be removed from european agricultural policy .
free and fair trade should be the guiding principle for an agricultural area based on sustainability .
this is an issue that concerns europeans , naturally , but also the citizens of the world .
that is why this reform should not be the business of experts , but rather of farmers and consumers .
we have to rethink the general objectives of a new common agricultural policy .
europeans have new expectations in terms of food production and supply .
we must maintain pillar 1 payments , rewarding farmers for work , securing the industry with direct payments .
we must define what we mean by a fair distribution of cap and look at production costs .
regional variation is vital .
we must maintain market control measures which control price volatility and ensure profitability .
it has my vote and that of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe .
the most important thing is that it acknowledges the injustice done to farmers of the new member states .
it draws attention to food security and the supply of high quality products at a reasonable price .
in truth , we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of cap funds to other policies could bring .
instead , we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common policy that exists in the eu .
i would also advocate market regulation in the dairy sector , from production to marketing .
this was the thrust of one of the various amendments that we have tabled to the report under discussion .
this route is also noted in the report .
we consider such a view unacceptable .
in addition to food production , agriculture also makes a significant contribution to preserving the cultural landscape .
the reality is quite different .
i also believe that it is essential to consider regionsterritorial features and priorities .
we must promote common norms and objectives , taking into account the specific nature of each region .
this will enable us to achieve dynamic , multifunctional and sustainable agriculture in europe .
i am delighted that my amendments along these lines have found their place in this text .
it is also advisable to retain specific tools to manage the production potential that some sectors have .
the biodiversity support measures must not be forgotten .
the 2009 crisis showed the weaknesses of the system of measures to support agriculture .
it is important to guarantee reasonable consumer prices and a fair income for farmers by using targeted aid .
market support measures are recognised as being an important part of the cap .
we have rejected any attempts to renationalise the policy .
the commission must come forward with ideas in this regard but caution is required .
this text has the merit of recognising market failures and advocating the fight against climate change .
there its merit ends .
on the contrary it supports productivism and the devastation of local crop farming here and throughout the world .
in truth , we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of cap funds to other policies could bring .
instead , we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common policy that exists in the eu .
the decoupling of assistance favours large landowners , and threatens small operations and family run farms .
despite the failure of the lisbon strategy , the eu has not changed its economic policy .
it is not committed to food security , but to competitiveness , which only favours large multinationals .
i believe that the agricultural sector needs to be considered as strategic within the european union .
i support the structure and approach of the lyon report .
thus , the adoption of this report is highly satisfactory .
in writing . yet again the european parliament has abdicated its responsibilities by failing to reform the cap .
i believe this report should be renamed theincrease in subsidies to inefficient farmersreport .
it penalises the efficient farmer and props up the inefficient one .
that is what cap reform should be about .
what the consumer cares about is quality and price .
this applies not only to cars and televisions , but also to bread , vegetables , meat and milk .
however , a functioning market and a competitive environment would solve this problem in a natural way .
now , like the rapporteur , it seems critical to me to restore our communal production .
imports of fishery and aquaculture products have increased enormously , but that increase has been necessary .
in my opinion , the environmental and social circumstances must also be taken into account .
imports are necessary .
i am not in favour of protectionism by stealth , but we do need to prevent unfair competition .
for that reason , I will be voting in favour of this own initiative report .
i voted in favour of the report by mr cadec .
imported products must satisfy the same quality criteria as those produced in the eu .
the report calls for the creation of an ecolabel for fisheries products .
at the same time , developing countries need to be able to develop their own fishing .
according to the report , europe currently imports 60 % of the fish it consumes .
having grown rapidly since 2005 , this market is increasingly dependent on imports .
i fully support the need to change and revitalise the eu's fisheries and aquaculture sector .
european fisheries cannot survive in the long term with protectionism and subsidies .
it is time to make up for the underestimates and delays of the past .
fishing is a key sector in our economic and social system and as such it must be respected .
in addition , greater attention should be paid to food security aspects in order to safeguard consumers .
the money saved as a result could be made available to programmes conducted by producersorganisations .
the quality of imported fishery products is extremely important in this context .
i therefore advocate a stringent policy of certification , which could control these problems effectively .
in writing . de for its survival , every state needs to maintain food self sufficiency .
fishing is important for food , and also ensures a variety of jobs .
with imports , however , adherence to our own rules can hardly be monitored .
the measures proposed are a step in the right direction , and I have voted for the report .
the community strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture was recently approved .
i agree with the rapporteur on the issue of customs protection .
for these reasons , I voted in favour of this report .
when there is a lack of knowledge among consumers , the only argument in the market becomes price .
therefore , it is necessary to tighten up legislation on identification .
thank you .
corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting see minutes
zimbabwe , in particular the case of farai maguwu
unfortunately , once again we are forced to address them .
this time it is the case of the human rights activist farai maguwu .
he is simply a prisoner of conscience .
this is clearly unacceptable .
secondly , we are dealing with the strange role that the monitor of the kimberley process has played .
ultimately , then , we are also dealing with the kimberley process itself .
it has proven to be a successful system .
they are not covered by this resolution and that is why we are demanding an amendment .
after all , all diamonds are mined in appalling conditions .
to say that the situation in zimbabwe is tragic is unfortunately an understatement .
the last elections took place in a climate of fear .
time and again these conditions have been condemned by ngos , including that of mr maguwu .
the intersessional meeting in tel aviv failed to reach a decision on the follow up to this report .
the european union is the main contributor of humanitarian aid to zimbabwe .
it must maintain its positions .
can you tell us what the position of the european union will be in st petersburg ?
i have to say this is one area where this house speaks with one voice .
today we are discussing the systematic abuse of workers in the diamond fields of zimbabwe by government security forces .
if I stand up and speak as an englishman , they will dismiss it .
as europeans , they will dismiss us .
we talk about africa being in your hands , and the future of africa being in your hands .
on the issue of the protection of human rights , this is a question of our fundamental credibility .
here , we must say clearlyyea , yea nay , nay.
human rights are being upheld or they are not .
we must not content ourselves with small advances .
i have the impression that in some of the speeches there was an element of satisfaction with small advances .
the keyword in this case is transparency .
the exploitation of diamonds has a role to play in combating poverty and achieving the millennium development goals .
today , however , we are talking about someone for whom diamonds may become a curse .
farai maguwu was arrested on charges of publishing information prejudicial to the state .
we know of constructive examples of the use of diamonds for development of the right kind .
botswana is one such case .
during the last 30 years the mugabe regime has made zimbabwe bankrupt and turned it into a humanitarian disaster .
blood diamonds are proof of the cynicism displayed by governing circles lacking scruples and respect for their own citizens .
zimbabwe is violating the standards stipulated by the kimberley process certification scheme for selling rough diamonds .
madam president , it is now less than five weeks since farai maguwu was detained by the zimbabwean authorities .
i also agree that african states have an important role to play in improving conditions there .
inevitably the wealth from these mines is now bankrolling mugabe's henchmen .
zimbabwe should therefore be refused readmission to the kimberley process .
in addition , we condemn the illegal arrests which are being made and demand the release of farai maguwu .
the eu delegation is monitoring his situation very closely .
this is an issue we have raised on various occasions and in different fora .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place shortly .
written statements rule 149 
in writing . I join the voices calling for the release of farai maguwu .
he was arrested for providing information on the kimberley process .
farai maguwu must be released from prison immediately .
venezuela , in particular the case of maria lourdes afiuni
this led to her incarceration in a maximum security prison , in conditions that are putting her life in danger .
amnesty international and the united nations high commissioner for human rights have indicated their great concern .
this is not an isolated case , ladies and gentlemen .
we have therefore requested that judge afiuni be freed immediately .
things have not improved since our last resolution quite the opposite .
several judges have become victims of such presidential behaviour .
some have been removed from office others have left the country .
there is no doubt this measure was taken to humiliate her and to frighten her .
es president chávez , judge afiuni must be freed immediately .
this would not only be fair on your part , but also a notable humanitarian gesture .
the question certainly deserves to be asked , as both combinations are common in hardline regimes .
what is the issue at stake here ?
she was arrested following this release and placed in detention .
it is true that her detention conditions are absolutely terrible , like those in all venezuelan prisons .
however , we are not holding an urgent debate on prisons here .
i agree with you on that , but I cannot agree with you on the rest .
author . es madam president , I am of the same opinion as mrs de keyser .
perhaps not in the form of an emergency resolution .
it will have escaped nobody's attention that we have elections very soon .
i have a very clear lack of affinity or political sympathy for mr chávez a complete lack .
he has now targeted the independence of the judiciary as a next obstacle to his assumption of absolute power .
how this judge can hope for a fair trial is beyond me .
this paradox continues to undermine the eu's collective efforts to expose the alarming trend towards totalitarianism in venezuela .
applause 
moreover , does he know that mr chávez poses a danger to democracy and the rule of law ?
mr posselt , it is a question of priorities .
what I am saying specifically is that we should keep clear what is important and what the priorities are .
that is why we have this campaign of vilification .
i am also filled with sadness by the attitude of mrs de keyser and mr romeva I rueda .
hopefully , nobody here would argue otherwise .
venezuela wanted to make civil society participation subject to domestic law .
there is a bad precedent .
the legitimacy of the next parliament is crucial in these times of deteriorating democracy .
sk I am outraged at the way president chávez is governing in venezuela .
during my previous speech I referred to journalists .
venezuela has been a land of refuge for many .
member of the commission . madam president , the eu is closely following the situation in venezuela .
we are following the tendency of political polarisation re emerging in the country with concern .
applause 
the vote will take place shortly .
written statements rule 149 
the case of maria lourdes afiuni is absolutely appalling to anyone who defends democratic values .
it highlights the fact that the rule of law is nothing but a meaningless concept in venezuela .
the politicisation of the judiciary has increased since hugo chávez came to power .
judicial authorities do not usually dare speak out against the government .
when this does happen , the consequences are drastic .
the venezuelan government must release judge afiuni quickly and stop its attacks on the independence of the judiciary .
north korea
the next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on north korea .
it is also a measure of how serious the situation is in kim jong il's famished empire .
we do not have the names of any dissidents or activists in the territory of north korea .
that information must be allowed to percolate through to us .
the situation there is even incomparable with that in the former soviet union or ceausescu's romania .
various concrete recommendations to this effect may be found in parliament's joint resolution .
well done !
i also wholeheartedly support paragraph 14 of the resolution .
madam president , officially north korea claims that it guarantees religious freedom to its population of 24 million .
what evidence is there of his crime 20 bibles and 10 worship tapes ?
it would appear that this is the thing that the north korean authorities literally mortally fear .
i would like to focus on two things .
there is a second point I would like to mention .
it is ridiculously difficult to get out of this country , to escape .
that is important when we consider the situation that these people are in .
what is currently happening here is appalling .
applause 
recently we have been able to see sportsmen from north korea playing at the fifa world cup .
in the following matches they did not do so well .
why am I talking about this sports event ?
afterwards , the players met with repression , and they were held in forced labour camps .
we are very worried about what is going to happen to these sportsmen next .
this is perhaps a country like no other in the world right now .
this should be one of the future topics of our discussions with china when we have our bilateral dialogue .
reportedly 80 % of north koreans in china end up as trafficking victims .
women are particularly vulnerable to prostitution , rape , arranged marriages and bride traffickers .
china must change its law to protect the victims of trafficking instead of returning them to north korea .
therefore I will not expand on what other colleagues have said .
the question really is , what can we do about it ?
there are 24 million people in north korea who need our assistance .
provision of a radio in a country where there is no information is actually a vital tool .
finally , we should do our best to assist refugees .
as other colleagues have said , people flee north korea and they are not given the assistance they deserve .
unfortunately , things are not as mr vigenin and mr martin have said .
this is unfortunate , because it would seem that on this question we ought to be united .
i come from a country which was ruled by communism .
this is something which we should guarantee .
however , there has also been the experience of footballers being made personally responsible for defeats .
i call on the north korean government to explain the whereabouts of the footballers .
even potential victories in football cannot mask the reality of the situation .
occasional news leaks come out from defectors and the reality is truly horrific .
the death penalty is applied regularly with no regard to the rule of law .
we all remain extremely concerned about north korea .
regrettably pyongyang has nuclear weapons and seeks collaboration with other nefarious regimes around the world , such as iran .
also the recent sinking of a south korean naval vessel was undoubtedly a deliberate attack by the north .
the government of the people's republic of korea denies the existence of the problem of human rights violations .
this is , however , at complete variance with the eye witness reports of refugees and defectors .
pl madam president , north korea and cuba are the last remnants of communism in the world .
the dream of many north koreans is simply to flee their own country .
however , life is better there than in north korea .
ro the human rights situation in north korea is giving particularly grave cause for concern .
the leadership in this country bans any form of political opposition , democratic elections , press and religious freedom .
according to reports , more than 150 000 north koreans continue to be held in six labour camps .
they are not given any kind of medical care and receive very little food .
torture and sentences in forced labour camps , often because of political views , are an everyday occurrence there .
how can we help the koreans in this situation ?
through an active joint approach by the great powers .
ro there are so many human rights violations in north korea that we cannot list them all .
the majority of those sent to these camps are no longer released .
if they have children , the latter can spend their whole life in captivity .
although perhaps unwillingly , the west has rather often turned its attention away from events on the korean peninsula .
therefore , we must talk specifically about the crimes which are being committed and renew our appeals .
member of the commission . madam president , I would like to congratulate parliament for undertaking this debate .
we will continue to do so .
these people cannot simply be regarded aseconomic migrants.
we very much welcome the convergence of views among members and between the members of parliament and the commission .
we should not punish them for the sins of their leaders .
the negotiated text for this free trade agreement provides for the possibility of designating outward processing zones .
she is , however , now considering all options to do it in the context of two things .
the third point is a proposal to press for the establishment of a commission of inquiry at the un .
with this in mind , we need to ensure that he has all the back up to do his job .
from the commission's position , we see this today as the better course in front of us .

What is your name ?
What's your name?
What's your name ?
I eat an apple

one year on , we are obliged to note that we are far from achieving this objective .
the next item is the vote .
i will record what you have said and it will appear in the minutes .
you did not do so .
that is what we want today and that is what we want after the elections in june .
there could be new risks for mental health as a result of the current financial and economic crisis .
fourthly choose a social internal market .
who but the european union could help transform the concept to a more sustainable one ?
you are not representing the council of the european union , you are representing yourself .
i think there is nothing worse than not letting those who benefit from a major project know about it .
the reform effort is already underpinned by a relatively large amount of bilateral assistance from the commission .
decisions concerning certain documents see minutes
it is important that our citizens see that our updated institutions are capable of providing solutions to real problems .
the life of mr abu jamal is now more at risk than ever .
i know that is one of your most important preoccupations .
people are questioning whether this is compatible with politics .
i have a number of observations to make .
so we ask the commission to send a clear message and take clear steps .
i count on your leadership .
we cannot allow the consumer to be misled by the food additive thrombin .
documents received see minutes
perhaps .
mr president , a friend who knows I was in gaza just three days ago challenges me .
also , on the issue of legal migration , we need to demonstrate a spirit of openness .
i believe that we have sent out the right message .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the stockholm action plan .
in 2010 , foreign policy will , as in previous years , be a tricky issue .
the european parliament expects the draft 2010 budget to help member states and citizens overcome the current crisis .
the answer isno.
the czech republic is the first country of central and eastern europe to take the eu presidency .
it obliges americans to obtain an international guarantee of immunity before participating in united nations operations .
you said that you have a strategy for bosnia .
however , we have not yet taken it a step further .
we reassert their right to defend themselves and to remain themselves .
unfortunately , president barroso was accused of not being democratically elected and of bullying the irish into submission .
that would represent a clear and unambiguous signal .
thank you very much .
we will do it together .
we will also be happy to have a solution that is fair to us .
this year , 2009 , is a fateful year for european cooperation .
bosnia herzegovina has been and continues to be the subject of intense negotiations at all levels of the council .
are those forces called murdoch , or something else ?
firstly , we must not , under any circumstances , cut back on training in the rail industry .
appropriate management of farms will result in carbon capture and greater food security .
you know , it is the same story with the eurovignette .
obviously , the environment is the major area where complaints come to us from citizens of the european union .
fourthly , they need investment security , in other words contractual protection and no more revisions .
of course , I also voted in favour of it .
she and I are both asking you to turn out in huge numbers and vote .
merry christmas and all the best to you .
this has even led to the modification of the european union's rural development policy .
may god be praised .
that is why I should like firstly to thank mr savary .
this is an international problem that must primarily be dealt with at international level .
on 21 december , I sent another letter to mr reinfeldt .
that is all this is about , but it is an important question .
we did not agree as to the instruments with which we can best achieve this .
that is an important right in europe .
they meet the criteria .
we do not prohibit someone who has stolen a bicycle from using the roads .
the ecr group believes that the almost comical name dispute with greece should be resolved sensibly and rapidly .
some of you have asked ,what is the point of all this ? 
it is not disputed in parliament that earmarking , the use of the revenues , is very important .
i personally consider macro regional strategy to be no less an important item on the council's discussion agenda .
energy efficiency is vitally important as regards environmental sustainability and as regards conserving finite resources .
i believe that each body has its own area of work .
the commission must now bear the overall responsibility again .
the information that has come to light about this acta court up to now is very dispiriting .

european funds are in fact one of the most visible and effective manifestations of european integration .

we share a common destiny , as mr trichet so rightly said .
loud applause 
i would urge members to read what that regulation now says .
not only children should benefit from programmes of this type , but their migrant parents too .
in addition , the gas crisis has once again demonstrated our dependency and vulnerability .
who will now pay the price for the political errors ?
decisions concerning certain documents see minutes
the intention now , however , is for this one stop shop also to decide on the train paths .
thank you very much .
this will undoubtedly be one of the central objectives of the informal meeting of the european council on thursday 
the concern is for next winter .
i would urge that more attention be paid to issues that directly affect the daily lives of citizens .
indeed , prior to our meeting , there appeared to be a wide divergence of views .
negotiations , which began last year , are currently underway with russia .
research in the construction sector is moving towards a greener approach to building .
the prime minister's resignation , the dissolution of parliament , early elections in short , democracy .
this is an important point that the eu will continue to emphasise to all of the relevant dialogue partners .
madam president , the number of people seeking refugee and asylum status is growing alarmingly .
now it is time to roll up our sleeves and come up with new solutions .
no european , no child of western civilisation , no civilised human being could disagree .
these measures should stabilise milk prices in the medium term .
motor vehicle block exemption regulation
every project that does not take this into account is doomed to failure .
i regret that the head of the council and the president of the european commission were not there .
it would appear that social policy and employment policy are being adapted selectively and flexibly to market forces .
however , the beneficiaries will be , once again , not the producers , but the processors and retailers .
he spoke about the human face of communism .
we must combat wage dumping .
i have to say that I completely disagree with that .
there are two options open to us .
i will do my utmost to have the agreement of the contracting parties that we can fully inform you .
another important issue in the debate was whether the ecolabel might be extended to food .
we need to take tough sanctions .
we have to bring that together .
nl I wish to raise a point of order based on article 168 2 .
dcm is one of these substances and must be taken out of circulation .
no , you are the commission !
the vote will take place during the first october part session .
thank you , mr kelly .
mr president , I will try to answer my fellow members .
member of the commission . madam president , I welcome the initiative and report by mrs neyts uyttebroeck .
we need common solutions to common problems .
i would , however , like to speak on the point about the internet in your programme .
these gaps in the gas grid must be closed , urgently .
my apologies for tabling it now .
these approaches together encourage reform within individual countries , and reinforce regional cooperation .
for years , the reports on turkey's progress have consisted of one long list of problems .
the reality of daily life shows that much progress remains to be made in the member states .
it is hard to believe that romania will be able to achieve this target by 20its potential is far greater .
it is quite intolerable that the council should walk out of this debate .
without them , there would be no euro .
our thoughts and our prayers are with them .
you have run out of time .
i hope that this accident will not have any impact on the outcome of the elections .
regional policy is the primary source of european investment in the real economy .
so , today , mr sarkozy is calling for an opt out from employment policies .
the way things are going in italy makes that country very vulnerable in its democracy .
it is a new start , as mrs malmström said .
eu red tape is strangling our entrepreneurs and the carbon tax scam is plunging millions into deadly fuel poverty .
these measures must be supported by legislative proposals which also guarantee the financial allocations .
the debate will continue until 11.00 .
the votes of the unionist meps today adds further to this shame .
it has to show decisiveness at the political level .
it will allow the eu to exert a real influence in the international arena .
this is a really important point .
an alarming number of member states have high levels of national debt .
however , unlike swift , there were definitely good reasons for this postponement .
financial imbalances are due to issues surrounding budgets and the balance of payments .
interconnection of business registers 
unfortunately , there are numerous current incidences of this within the eu too .
the commission's proposal to set some maximum tariffs is the matter we are discussing now .
we therefore reject the oral amendment .
we will support proposals of this kind , but we will fight every attempt to destroy regional policy .
thank you very much , mr schulz .
meanwhile , outrageous human rights abuses continue unabated as juveniles and homosexuals are executed routinely .
i am speaking first now , but really to make a point to the presidency .
reread parliament's resolution and immediately opt for an unconditional 30 % .
to achieve this , we must continue to work on the development of our strategic partnership .
it is right to fight for freedom and values for all , not big jobs for the lucky few .
finally , I think that the timetable is very important .
written statements rule 149 
closure of the sitting
i am not going to make hypothetical statements about hypothetical referendums .
they are already under represented in the iraqi parliament and this is certain to lead to more tension and instability .
rise in food prices vote 
i am actually from an electoral constituency where 99 % of the electorate are catholic .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8

it is absolutely paramount to focus this support in the areas most affected by land abandonment .
i talked with him for an hour just before he left for the united states to meet president obama .
unfortunately , copenhagen brought absolutely no progress on this matter .
within this framework , simplifications could be made and distinctions drawn .
that is true outside the eurozone as well as inside it .
can we convert that into a grant ?
that offers opportunities , but must be handled with great care .
my second question is the following .
naturally , you must check the law and the legislation what is the alternative ?
we are employing energy ever more rationally .
it is on the list of terrorist organisations and it is difficult to take action against it .
these are the main issues and they cover various directions where the commission acts to reduce poverty .
in addition , the demands of consumers regarding the quality of food are increasing .

a party put forward a candidate before the elections .
such aid is particularly important in the context of developing trust and reconstructing the country .
this treaty gives us new objectives .
i also want to warn against any thoughts about subsuming development policy as part of our foreign policy .
surely the way in which the authorities are responding to this undermines this freedom .
we do not agree with the fingerprinting of children of 14 years of age .
that is the task that this strategy must allow us to fulfil .
what action can be expected ?
amendment of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 may 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management 
the sitting was opened at 09 05

in addition , it has brought about an increase in the range of services being offered .

madam president , I come with two questions for the commissioner . one what is culture ?
the violence must stop .
parliament has set out numerous questions in writing to the commission and the council .
naturally , I also wish to personally express my support for all the families affected by these tragic events .
i now turn to the issue of encouraging member state cooperation while permitting external providers .
these cannot be seen as a consolation .
progress in the negotiations remains slow .
i wanted to show that we can do even better .

the top priority for the coming weeks must be to work together to turn our intentions into reality .
key objectives for the conference of the parties to the cites debate 
we also need to take into account the problems of the dairy farmers in austria and the alpine region .
democracy is vital , of course .
in that regard I am entirely behind the commission's approach .
adequate technical and logistical means are necessary in order for the work to be carried out quickly and efficiently .
and the name of one of the murderers is cesare battisti .
each member state's foreign relations must be subject to democratic control .
the previous criteria for support of these areas must be modified so that they reflect actually existing handicaps .
against this background , I am calling for higher safety standards on the railways .
as for the second question I just want to underline that lorries have nothing to do with tax havens .
why should reputable businesses suffer at the hands of unfair competitors who profit when consumers are not compensated ?
the same applies to the simplifying provisions .
we fully recognise the growing strategic importance of the arctic region .
it is pleasing to see that a number of amendments that tended to contaminate this text have been withdrawn .

the solution to this situation is obviously not for us to discontinue the european union's common agricultural policy .
sk the hungarian representatives are misleading european public opinion with many untruths .
i would like to highlight a few key issues .
the last neeaps arrived at the commission in june 200many of them confirmed that they found the cross sectoral effort needed to prepare them very useful .
the law also makes it hard to justify the international community's massive military and financial assistance to afghanistan .
if we are talking about further development of the technology , then this must be in all areas .
what about the conflict of interest in the gas sector in russia , the kremlin's influence on gazprom ?
it is also full of examples of so called minority opinions ultimately proving to be correct .
our group therefore voted against .
these businesses will have to keep supporting documents clearly showing transactions carried out and their own financial situation .
it is therefore simply a matter of getting started .
if we achieve all of this , then russia will take us seriously and we will co exist well .
that , you see , is a fundamental part of the whole blue card system .
this is not easy , but I would like to draw your attention to a number of successes .
the rules must be made clearer , information more accessible , the administrative burden lighter and procedures more transparent .
these resolutions are binding for eu member states under international law .
now we shall be conducting an election campaign where things are being shifted to brussels again .
we should not react negatively to the wordmarket.
president in office of the council . let me underline that it is not a lack of political will .
there is a certain contradiction here .
moreover , an a class tyre is more cost effective in the long run .
at the same time , I would like to raise two matters .
extending europe's ambitions to the entire planet would result in global warming of 4 degrees .

this situation is simply unsustainable .
let me begin with trade , because quite a lot of the different contributions focused on that .
nevertheless foods must be included in this regulation , because otherwise .
let me underline two very important milestones along this road .
more than 60 % of all fish consumed in europe today is imported .
this will further increase the gap between the eu15 and the 12 new member states .
i do not regard that as justified if you compare it with the economic consequences of this crisis .
it merely serves to expose the eu's arrogant disregard for democratic opinion .
there is a group there which , by international standards , is classified as far right .
in my opinion , this is not what mr vatanen's report promises .
the rapporteur might want to bear this in mind .
gender equality and women's rights stem from human rights .
the haemorrhage of jobs must be stopped .
this help can come from us in different shapes and forms .
but that is not about kick starting economic growth in abusiness as usualdirection .
the possibility of using tax revenue to clear the deficit has not been totally excluded .
i believe that this is a good thing , which makes holding the double referendum worthwhile .
are we also considering , within the southern corridor , the white stream caspian georgia black sea ukraine romania project ?
it is , of course , possible to provide you with the necessary details if you are interested .
as members know , we are pursuing a range of bilateral agreements in conjunction with this .

this is very important .
we must ensure that the laws remain balanced and feasible .
i myself am a beneficiary of cross border health care .
children of users and , in particular , of farmers , are also affected .
however , economic depression is not a time for moral depression .
president obama has already rightly emphasised this point .
last weekend was a triumph for communication .
this should be a warning to countries outside the eurozone .
furthermore , the amendment suggests that a unilateral european form of such a tax should be considered .
jobbik believes that it is possible to rid political life of corruption .
those who want to see a better europe should vote against this resolution .
now , however , we all know that it will cost european taxpayers a great deal .
it is not a case of us asking for money for ourselves , as alleged by the press .
let me say quite clearly that we are not against financial support .
i look forward to hearing further from commissioner barnier .
last but not least , there is definitely the issue of interconnection .
therefore , there are two issues .
for that reason , the commission cannot accept amendments 4 , 5 , 21 , 23 and in addition we can positively consider the second part of the amendment regarding the derogations on distance .
the list of the greatest powers is becoming increasingly limited to germany and , at best , france .
this is exactly the opposite to what the commission and the council are proposing .

in 2008 , by far the most common allegation I examined was lack of transparency in the eu administration .
this is the situation we are in at the moment .
the vertical divisions in society and the domination of tribal loyalties over personal judgment would make that impossible .
laughter 
i therefore very much welcome this resolution and parliament's strong support for sepa .
thank you for being here , mr van rompuy .
the second point is that the european union ambassador will manage commission funds in future .
of course , we also condemn the coup d état and any attempt to seize power by undemocratic means .
closure of the sitting
in the meantime , these difficulties have been overcome and there are no technical reasons which would prevent harmonisation .
that is not right , either .
the president of the commission is a man , as are almost 70 % of the commissioners .
obviously , there are matters which also concern the summit under way today here in brussels .
unfortunately , not all consumers are aware of this .
the macro financial assistance programme sets out to complement other financing from the union .

we need to be aware that every euro we spend comes from the taxpayer .
i would have to do so at least twice a week .
quite the opposite .
finally , I would also like to say that this cannot be the end of the line just yet .
in 2008 , the commission contributed an opinion to the negotiations on the review of the ombudsman's statute .
it has not been thought through .
here I would like to reply by saying that the commission has already actively committed itself .
thank you .
i think it is also absolutely right that you raise the importance of being visible on the ground .
texts of agreements forwarded by the council see minutes
where should we place our emphasis ?
we were in agreement on every single case .
there is certainly much which needs to be improved .
in its first year , 20 of the 27 member states have signed this convention .
there cannot be an agreement unless there is funding tailored to developing countries .
de mr president , let me briefly address two issues .
may I wish you every success in your work and bon courage .
that is why turkey should be welcomed into the eu fold .
the czech prime minister , jan fischer , was also with us and we tried to asses this situation .
this is all the more significant because of the current economic crisis .
eventually , only the top 10 % to 20 % of products per category can be awarded the ecolabel .
the president of the european council is not yet accounted for in the budget .
i hope that the commission will take this request by the european parliament on board .
the defence procurement directive will satisfy these concerns .
that has been a great pleasure .
they have failed resoundingly .
it is also possible that this example could encourage the other un countries to take the same action .
millions of people are freezing and factories are being shut .
we have had to deal with that .
these are very important attributes in the times we live in .
the fall in the prices of milk and dairy products primarily affects farms with low incomes .

that is very important .
the debate is closed .
we now need to think about how we can re engage a political process .
we are aware of the serious effects that it has caused in the world and in the european union .
parliament made all the running it made all the compromise proposals .
as far as I know , though , commissioner , the commission is independent of the member states .
the aim is the step by step liberalisation of trade between the eu and the partner regions or individual states .
in writing . pt I voted against this joint motion for a resolution .
piracy and counterfeiting are a growing problem for the european economy and for other economies throughout the world .
we cannot fail to react to the brutal action which has been seen in guinea .
the important thing in my view is that the court of auditors is not talking about fraud or embezzlement .
the number of employees taking so called voluntary redundancy is increasing .
trade and transport in the region are developing apace .
do you actually want to reward this negative development ?
i believe what is significant about the council conclusions is that they are very clear .
however , not only do we have too little authority , we have too little money .
i hope you will write about your experiences and impressions .
in addition , nothing has happened with offshore banking the mechanism has simply not been brought into play .
that is the only way for the population to regain trust in their leaders .

that could only enhance the role of europe in this matter .
therefore , we need effective sanctions .
we have all been appalled by the pictures of canadian seal hunting .
although the compromise is far better than the original proposal , we have not succeeded fully .
secondly , the impact of the eu going it alone .
i am therefore particularly pleased to see that the commission is willing to examine this case .
i have to say we were not expecting this change .
i thank the epp for the support it has given me .
it is the spanish presidency that we are discussing .
their purpose is to change what we value change how we conduct ourselves .
member states will have sufficient room to manoeuvre to implement this accordingly .
these deficits inevitably mean that governments have less room for manoeuvre in terms of their budgetary policies .
for the new budgetary procedure to proceed efficiently in the autumn , we must work together and be disciplined .
domestic violence and forced marriages continue to be common .
the us privacy act still discriminates against non us citizens even commission officials admit that .
the us and china and others will probably ensure that there are no great expectations of mexico .
the current compromise has been achieved as a result of difficult negotiations .
coming out of an election campaign , we know what this is all about .
my third point is that we must follow developments outside europe .
the next item is the one minute speeches on matters of political importance .
written statements rule 149 
the regulation must bolster consumer confidence throughout the european food chain .
it was faster , safer and more convenient for passengers .
i will ensure that the commission will keep parliament fully and immediately informed throughout the process of negotiations .
in addition , we want to help to overcome the crisis .
let me now turn to the issue of turkey .
it appeared in the following six resolutions .
we call on both sides of the conflict to minimise civilian losses and to commence peace negotiations .

this would result in nearly 1.5 billion working poor worldwide .

ladies and gentlemen , I would ask you to support this directive .
the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149 8

it took political leadership to achieve that .
it is very , very difficult .
i have five minutes for the ppe de group , so could I just say my last few words ?
that is why we decided to abstain .
i deeply regret the fact that the resolution has been watered down as regards the anti discrimination dossier .
in writing . pt the great hopes surrounding the much vaunted copenhagen summit have been dashed .
i would like to ask the commissioner to take action on this issue .
otherwise , we shall see a repeat of the same situation .
colleagues have raised the issues of why people feel the need to move to look for work .
the first concerns flexibility .

i think innovation will be key for the development of the european economy in the future .
the information that leads to them being placed on the blacklist regularly originates from secret services .
president klaus was able to speak here unhindered .
as such , we should focus on these buildings and houses immediately .
obviously it is very difficult to speak with all this confusion in any case I am finishing .
we should like to say here that the principle of passenger safety must be reaffirmed as the priority principle .
there are legitimate concerns about body scanners .
we did not do this for the military coup in honduras .
public confidence in these systems is absolutely vital .
unfortunately , the processing of these applications by the european commission drags on for years .
it must also be made clear to what extent innovations such as electric engines are actually covered .
let us not blame turkey for the eu's internal difficulties .
i would very much like to encourage you to continue on this route in this eu arctic debate .

transatlantic judicial and police cooperation .
so there are very many differences and we must not treat these events as clear examples of religious persecution .

no one , not even germany , can count on more gas from gazprom for many years to come .

the internal market is important , and so it is also important that agreements be made between member states .

the deaths of anna politkovskaya , natalya estemirova , zarema sadulayeva , andrei kulagin must not remain meaningless .
the union must remain vigilant and committed so that international efforts on this issue can remain demonstrably effective .
after all , it is indeed a case of unlawful conduct .
we have a comprehensive agenda , which includes many issues that affect the welfare of us all .
the administrative board should therefore be congratulated on its decision to begin to develop this kind of programme .
i know , for example , that it is extremely difficult to find an airline's complaints department .
the vote will take place today .
at any rate , everything can be revised .
it is therefore extremely important that the directive is duly implemented .

that is what we need to see for the europe 2020 agenda .
i deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields .
in any case , believe me that I will do everything in my power to ensure this .
the statistics for my country , greece , are tragic .
adjournment of the session
i would have preferred to see this done at european level from the word go .
according to the government in manila , abu sayyaf is collaborating with al qaida .
because europe is not yet capable of putting forward his vision , ideals and knowledge .
the company's good reputation may be lost as a result of its involvement in human or drugs trafficking .
the european parliament is actively involved in these debates .
many of the causes lie elsewhere .
we need to achieve cost reality here to really bring about a situation where market economic instruments regulate traffic .
we cannot continue discussion on this matter indefinitely .
madam president , I voted against the proposal , mainly because I come from the united kingdom .
however , this is not a problem which is specific to italy .
pl I could not support the resolution , although it is extremely important for the european economy .
the health of the latter depends on the quality of the produce of the former .
there is a clear disparity between the seriousness of what happened in azerbaijan compared .
this is because the choice of us president matters to europeans .
the progress of certain projects of vital interest to the european union's development also depends on energy security .
we should also look to a positive side of the agenda that we also gain a technological advantage .
i was pleased to hear both deputy prime minister vondra and president barroso speak about targets .
madam president , energy policy and foreign policy are inextricably interlinked now more than ever .
i think it is decades since we experienced a situation like the one we are seeing today .
the debate is closed .
applause 
this morning , I chanced upon a website of a government organisation called joint task force guantánamo .
this is a major achievement .
this fragmentation makes visibility suffer .
this is our intention .
this measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy .
we therefore wish mr al debaqbasi and his colleagues a fruitful stay with us .
i have a specific proposal we will reach this point in the second part of the vote .
we must not forget the citizen and consumer in our recovery strategy .
this is the sad paradox I wanted to share with all of you this afternoon .
it is true that the european social fund has technically been the main source of funding so far .
who will manage the new technology ?
we should all reflect on that .
the union shall take measures to ensure coordination of the employment policies . 
an increased contribution by the member states is desirable .
what purpose does it serve in finding a long term solution ?
in other words , we absolutely must avoid the mistakes of the lisbon strategy .
having noted the quality of the report , I supported it with my vote .
we need strong , improved coordination of our international , as well as our european , economic policy .
if necessary there will be fact finding visits in situ to establish facts or indeed to seek a solution .
in reforming the cap , we must not forget the principles of integration , solidarity and community .
the presidency will continue to take forward the negotiations .
we are lobbying for support for the nuclear weapons convention and the hiroshima nagasaki protocol , because disarmament is possible .
that concludes this item .
it is true that today the european union faces new and serious challenges .
the few jobs which may be on offer depend on the goodwill of the parties .
there has been a 95 % reduction in consumption of ods compared with the baselines set .
firstly , I think that treating healthcare exclusively as a marketable service is a mistake .
de thank you , madam president .
i am actively looking at whether we can provide additional funding in all of these areas .
at this one , a very clear issue is going to be at stake .
it could , by itself , be the biggest help for businesses in the european union .
it is mainly the universities which will benefit from this money and carry out the research .
europol is an agency which must be controlled because it benefits from this agreement .
europe cannot stand still and remain silent in the face of this conflict .
it is up to ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt .
however , certain essential issues have been relegated to secondary status .
i will not stand for that .
approval of the new allocation of the responsibilities of vice president of the commission jacques barrot vote 
what type of growth ?
after this disappointment , it is important to regain the initiative .
discharge 2005 european network and information security agency vote 
it is a means to improve the working of the european union .
we were concerned about the timetable and scope of application of the future initiatives on procedural rights .
we also oppose the establishment of flexibility mechanisms .
what is more , a strategic vision is being developed that is almost entirely focused on the member states .
it should be further developed and expanded into an effective protection instrument by the eu .
we want it to cover the debate on pluralism in italy and in europe .
the wordcreation.
the eu must invest more in the diversification of energy supply sources .
with a good administrative system there is a clear division of responsibility .
we need to act , but fighting this alone will not work .
this reduces the risk of error and the costs of control .
the sitting was closed at 12 midnight 
it is unacceptable to give eu funds to third countries without any established indicators .
the population has low life expectancy , low levels of education and literacy and high demographic growth .
i do not get the impression that we are on such a path .
the european union is facing , once again , a crisis with its supply of natural gas .
the court's chief prosecutor , luis moreno ocampo , has skilfully helped the court to strengthen its impartiality globally .
their quality of life is also deteriorating .
perhaps you could tell us more about this .
this gives us the opportunity to identify positive and less positive experiences of the implementation of the regulation .
where is the deputy secretary general , since he is not at this debate ?
the eu will continue to provide considerable political , technical and financial support to georgia .
the responsibility for the failure therefore lies fairly and squarely with the council .
i want to know if any assessment has been made .
the commissioner said that you need to be realistic in the commission .
and innovativeness is the key to competitiveness and growth of the european economy .
it is essential that eulex cooperates well with the parties concerned in kosovo .
they did not kill anyone .
we agreed on the priorities very quickly and together managed to introduce rational elements and points of departure .
we are right to go for an ambitious trade agreement .
as regards croatia's imminent eu accession , it is regrettable that border disputes with slovenia remain outstanding .
read it I do not have the time to read it out .
the debate is closed .
we cannot regulate prices indefinitely , as this affects innovation and may even affect competitiveness .
this is a compromise to which the council has already given its approval .
however , the region does not deserve this .
to run such an operation , smes are de facto forced to found a company in the target country .
i do not see any sign of this progress .
global warming is one of the most complicated issues which the whole planet is facing .
in any case , commissioner , it is not competition that is at stake here .
b7 0013 / 2010 b7 0014 / 2010 b7 0202 / 2010 b7 0203 / 2010 .
i particularly believe that the european union must treat this situation seriously and diplomatically .
flexibility and pragmatism have therefore been necessary when apportioning the governance incentive fund .
the strength of the eu lies in its open borders and free trade .
the sitting was closed at 4.20 p.m. 
i am also indebted to the commissioner and to the services of the commission .
we tried that and the banks are still not lending .
the european job mobility action plan 2007 2010 
we need to remember this resolution and parliament's position .
first of all , it seems rather questionable as to whether the timeframe was sufficient .
i welcome this .
this is also a political issue .

i completely agree on the three reasons for the situation .
we are told that farmers in ireland did well and that is true .
the idea here is precisely to find common forward looking solutions at an eu level .
however , it has now reached the limits of what it can do .
such criteria may assist in building a certain image or providing a certain level of service .
but I think there are some specific things , to be more concrete , that we can do .
finally , I would like to add my voice in calling for the release of the judge .
i think it is a logical thing also vis à vis the citizens .
i saw what happened when democracy fails .
you will remember how we clashed over your interpretation of this house's rules of procedure .
the smallest agencies have more difficulty in following the onerous procedures imposed by eu legislation .
this is , however , a strategic question , in which the council's committed support is indispensable .
i would still like to believe in an about turn by europe .
the commission has proposed exactly the same solution for labelling products in which thrombin is used as a glue .
let us not forget , however , that the statistics were also european .
we need a humane asylum and immigration policy .
i believe that we have many points of view in common .
we have one result in south korea .

we have to turn this situation around and the social agenda should help achieve that .

the progress in the development of these guidelines is , so far , very encouraging .
we , parliament , have long been fighting for more rights particularly in the field of agriculture .
i would like to thank parliament for treating the commission's proposals for revamping the fund with such speed .
from this perspective , unfortunately , there is nothing new in your programme .
we now pay out funds based on simple technical requirements .
quotas have increased , while production has fallen .
therefore , I come with high expectations of how democracy will be handled in this parliament .
bring in a cease fire !
mr president , I will conclude .
i think that we should focus on them .
the tbc and nabucco projects are affecting the political stability of our neighbours .
we must give priority to the way in which our homes are designed .
these relate directly to the health of our children , who play with the toys that we buy them .
tomorrow in my constituency of london , we celebrate the anniversary of the 7 / 7 bombing .
our focus must be on the people themselves .
anyone violating it also violates international law and that is something this house really cannot accept .
it is interesting how we often talk about european common values and solidarity with the citizens .
do not reject it .
2009 was a good year for the candidate country of the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom .
if parliament were to approve this amendment , we would be in breach of article 2accordingly , it is declared to be inadmissible .
everything has a positive side too , however .
we have a saying in czech thathe who gives quickly gives twice.
a convincing european strategy to create a stronger europe should take leadership on global level .
the reason for my abstention is not complicated .
compromises were hard fought , and I think we have made a step forward on the common visa policy .
please could you answer this ?
it is also a question of who the commissioners are and which portfolios they have .
i agree with the first speech .
it has a moral and political dimension , but also a security and legal dimension .
we have lost years .
please inform the technical service .

nonetheless , there is a broad consensus that it should be done now .
the only thing is that the votes will be held on 5 and 6 may .
there is going to be an exhibition on this subject in brussels .
today , however , the commission is proposing to abolish the existing exemption for the sale of new vehicles .

you spoke about the responsibility of member states .
that is the point of my speech .

it would certainly have resulted in a rejection .

rating agencies know that they will not get the work if they question the solvency of their clients .

the programme of our activities for 2009 is very substantial about nine sectoral ministerial conferences are scheduled .
this is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate .
as I have said , it is not in the interests of the workers .
we must take these decisions in a way that is democratic , open and allows transparency .
it should be constructed within the member states and the community institutions .
i welcome the general support parliament has given to our approach to multilingualism .

interjection from the floor 
the commission will continue to analyse the link between food prices and energy prices .
it would be cynical , then , not to take very forceful action .
i really hope that parliament will also take part in this debate .
not so much with the presidency of the council as such , but with the member states .

instead of heading for the rocks of isolation , let us together chart the course of cooperation .
as you heard , four rapporteurs have been working on elements of it .

that is clearly the case .
how high is the hit rate of the annual policy strategy in this respect ?
secondly , we must successfully put in place effective supervision and a much more demanding form of bank stabilisation .
as a result , those companies would no longer be tempted to engage in illegal activities .
that is the first task to be carried out .
i noted a similar commitment and positive approach in negotiations with representatives of the european parliament's various directorates general .

we are also completing the independent study by a group of researchers and experts chaired by professor fabrizio barca .

this specific context is characterised by the combination of three major cycles .
in the current crisis , extending the food programme and financing it from the community budget are fully justified .

energy security is first and foremost the responsibility of our own governments .
i am greatly in favour of your further term and I will vote for it .
we hope that negotiations can be concluded within this year .
this is challenging but it is a serious omission from the whole concept of the single market .
in writing . I welcome parliament's commitment to this cause .
mr president , the summit will only be a success if binding agreements are reached .
it is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions .

applause 
the political situation is still fragile .
the court of auditorsannual report on the 2008 accounts shows no significant improvement .
el mr president , my fellow members have already addressed every aspect of this issue .
in 2009 , only eur 37 million were mobilised , out of a possible eur 500 million .
however , this substance represents a group of around a hundred others .
furthermore , no policy can truly function without cross sectoral implementation .
what it does do is produce ever more laborious and ever more ludicrous measures .
nevertheless , the eca has not been able to give the commission a positive statement of assurance for years .
all of that is grotesque .

financial assistance is required by dairy farmers immediately .
we must find answers to these questions before the european council in june .
that said , the strategic dilemma is clear .

mr president , commissioner , I would like to make three brief comments .
the ertms specifications have been available since 2000 .

let me say a word on afghanistan .
together , we have shown that , even in very difficult circumstances , europe can make decisions .
how can we best protect the interests of our citizens and consumers ?

as a result , since 1993 , the number of non citizens has fallen by 59 % .
we must have more facts and not fiction , and we certainly should dwell on the facts .
then , of course , there is the economic climate in which we find ourselves these days .
this is therefore a difficult situation .
do we have the resources to confront them ?
this means building a robust and transparent international accounting framework for countriesemissions and performance .

to this day , ratko mladić has not had to answer to the courts .
i will quote one figure eur 400 billion .
i am sure that we want this to happen .
mr brown has not a shred of credibility now .
you have mentioned them and they are particularly important .
we are pleased that this expires in six monthstime .
the presidency wants to achieve success , and it wants this above all else .
this , in turn , would have adverse effects on food production and the economy .
but the truth is that the euro did protect the countries which share the single currency .
the dramatic images convey one clear message .
it is at the heart of our middle east policy .
perhaps I should add that a consultation would be better than an infringement procedure .
this is , so to say , the general line .
it is good that we have had a first rate expert in the field as our rapporteur on this issue .
the eu solidarity fund allows us to act as a community to alleviate misery and suffering .
we are currently developing a shared vision of the future of the economy and the labour market in europe .

we should also concentrate all our mental energies and our financial resources on investing in renewable energy .
the tight link between public finances and the financial and economic crisis is very clear .
we ought to take advantage of that fact .

before the vote 
let us have these people and their human rights in mind when we vote .
the prerequisites for comparisons between the member states simply do not exist for numerous different reasons .
the loss of human lives was coupled with the destruction of most civilian infrastructure .
however , there is a large gap when it comes to the means to be used .
so , this system has already saved many lives in europe and elsewhere .
our response to it must be massive and concentrated .
thirdly , we are working on a strategy for combating climate change and this is good .

that is simply contrary to the international conventions .
what the georgian state authority did is a crime against the people of ossetia and abkhazia .
europe must take its fair share of this responsibility .
in the commission's opinion , this should not happen .
there is no excuse there is no possible justification .
we must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope .
the debate is closed .
it is the issue of financing that remains open .
we must make sure its principles are upheld in all member states .
in this respect , standardisation of electric vehicles becomes vital .
these are , for us , essential values and principles that represent the cornerstone of the european integration process .
our text would read 
otherwise , all of our good intentions on safety , on job creation , are doomed .
this cannot continue either .

moreover , cooperation with the council on the matter of budget discharge leaves a great deal to be desired .
in writing . I strongly support this report .
firstly , our efforts with regard to climate so far have brought us no benefits .
this amendment was rejected by the house and therefore I abstained in the final vote .
we have a practice and a custom .
in real terms , it tries to disregard the european parliament .
mr president , may I add a personal remark .
last but not least , allow me to make two proposals .

nl madam president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you to the commission for its statement .
i see this report as a seed at least .
and for this reason , I will vote in favour of the report .
secondly , negotiation .

currently , many would claim that the eurozone problem is one which should be solved by eurozone members .
you mentioned the high representative .
president of the commission . I think the meeting we had with ukraine was successful .
one such principle which is required on an official visit to belarus is a meeting with the opposition .
in doing so , the commission underlines both the internal and the external dimension of the decent work agenda .
however , I have some reservations about how this parliament and the eu legislate on this matter .
there would be a risk there of unfair competition .
these things are only seemingly superficial .
mr president , I shall make no remarks about football .
it is therefore crucial that the european union participates constructively in the 15th conference of the parties next march .

in my opinion , we are not talking enough about climate change .

our task as politicians is to ensure that there is good competition on the internal market .

this is a commitment to the women of today and also to the women of future generations .
in this respect , I call on the commission to show greater commitment to achieving these goals .

it will not surprise you to learn that I am resolutely in favour of the first of these arrangements .
what was new was that in april , parliament put a stop to it .
it is estimated that this directive could mean the banning of 15 % of pesticides .
therefore , we cannot support parliament's position at second reading .
it has helped to open a new chapter in the history of european union success .
the various countries held very different opinions on this issue .
however , the negotiations still need to be steered in this direction .

thank you , mr president .
i would like to conclude on that note .
i am thinking of the matter of safety .
agenda of the next sitting see minutes
opening of the sitting
i think this is a really significant development that all committees in this parliament need to engage with .
my third point is that this strategic document specifically underlines the need for investment in the energy supply infrastructure .
however , we do not believe that the lisbon treaty provides any real advance in this field .

using the most up to date science as a tool can only help the task ahead of us .
i think it is absolutely abysmal that you have done that .
why do we distrust peer reviewed science to such an extent ?
i would like to emphasise two key points .
finally , it goes without saying that safety is essential .
mr president , this is not a point of order .
lay offs should be a last resort intelligent work sharing and reskilling should be used instead .
therefore , be sure that we will do whatever we can to continue working towards that goal .
the eu and member states must earmark the necessary financial resources for this purpose .
what are the main conclusions of this long consultation process ?
2009 will also be the 30th anniversary of the first direct elections to the european parliament which you represent .
you disregard international law and you purport to be a responsible legal personality , as lisbon would make you .
that insecurity has been markedly intensified in the light of last year's conflict with russia .
of course , it is a good compromise .
the reason for that is quite simple .
these lead to distortions of competition and weaken national undertakings .
this is the only way we can face the future with certainty .
the eu has an extremely important role to play in this regard in both countries .
the eu 2020 strategy must find solutions to meet these expectations .
they must also take action themselves to eliminate the many abuses in their communities .
stress tests must challenge beyond the comfort zone of assumptions , and correlation factors should remain under active review .
i think that the council should be present for the majority of the plenary part session .
currently , all activity is limited to cooperation between individual research establishments .
i know that the original amendment 138 did not have the optimal form judicially .
i believe that the agreement must be global , ambitious and with a clear timeline .
i will , of course , make sure that mr potočnik gets a full account of it .
there is a government that can be condemned and censured .
however , hamas misused these facilities .
freedom of movement is one of the key pillars of the european single market .
this year , the exact same thing is happening with the european freight corridors .
in my opinion , the eu's handling of the migration phenomena truly brings shame on europe ...
the member states are reduce their developmentalal aid and preventing developing countries from achieving the millennium developmentalal goals ...
this has my unconditional support ...
for this reason , I have voted in favour of this impeccable report by mr claeys ...
this agency is conceived as an important instrument of the common european strategy towards illegal immigration ...
we greens did not see many problems there , so we voted in favour ...
therefore , I am voting for the ep position ...
furthermore , article three states thatmembers shall voting on an individual and personal basis ...
agreements concerning the way in which the mandate is to be exercised shall be null and vacuum ... 
this situation is reprehensible , intolerable and scandalous ...
the cases of our fellow member , mr tomaševski , entails , as it were , two problems ...
therefore , I decided to endorse the application for defence of the immune and privileges of valdemar tomaševski ...
the karas report is in line with the european response to the greeks crises ...
the european eu has learnt a lesson from greece's experience ...
the notion of turning eurostat into an audit institution was rejected five years ago ...
however , what is relevant is that the proposal now has every chance of being implemented ...
accurate , credible statistical information is a precondition for the economic and monetary eu to operate properly ...
such values should be established as early as possible in relation to the notification duration ...
this will allow them to assess the state of a country's public finances ...
this report is other step towards monitoring the internal workings of countries , this time through statistics ...
this report advocates absolute respect for the stability and growth pact ...
it urges the introduction of unannounced controls on the budget of the member states ...
it builds up suspicion into a political doctrine by demanding that member states who falsify their statistics face sanctions ...
the european project cannot allow itself to become confused with this high-handedness which contradicts the sovereignty of the persons ...
it applies without say that this is a scandal ...
this type of thing must never happen again ...
only in this way will the stability pact be value the document it is writing on ...
i therefore voted in favour of this report ...
if the previous information is known , there is no need for extra arguments ...
harmonisation of statistical information collection 
standardising of statistical and budgetary information supplied by the member states 
i therefore voted in favour ...
i supported this report ...
i welcome the report on the european eu strategy for the baltic sea region ...
the baltic sea strategy is the prime attempt to make use of macro regions ...
this macro region will not be competitors with the member states it will complement them ...
this new form of governance will undeniably bring added value to local , domestic and european policies ...
the purpose of the strategy is to solve common problems and to concentrate action on achieving common objectives ...
there are two major areas of interest for this region the environment and scientific developmental ...
these are four particularly important steps for lithuania ...
the only merit of this report is that it demands the elimination of pollution in the baltic sea ...
this elimination is necessary for the conservation of our ecosystem ...
it must be transported out as rapidly as possible ...
as for its stated desire to establish highly competitive european macro regions , this is completely intolerable ...
throughout these regions , they are aiming once again to dismantle the welfare state ...
the remediation of the baltic sea region cannot be transported out in the way advocated by liberalism ...
this is an important part of the external relations of the eu and its member states ...
the baltic nuclear triangle being created is not just a concern for lithuania but the whole of europe ...
in the eu , it is important to have a macro region vision of the baltic sea region ...
the eu cannot forbid the construction of nuclear power plants right next to the eu's borders ...
however , together we can negotiate with the belarusian government on the location of the construction ...
this report advocates the importance of developing strategies for macro regions in the european eu ...
these are seen as a set of territories grouped around common objectives and problems ...
in writing ......... the eu strategy owns enormous potential for us and our neighbouring within several political areas .........
optimal results can only be achieved with the pooling of resources towards commonly defined goals ...
we also need to tackle the lack of appropriate infrastructures and accessibility between various transport networks ...
the implementation of the strategy has been slow so far ...
we need to lower start the process and step up our efforts ...
i congratulate the rapporteur on a very well prepared report ...
the document refers to several crucial issues the environment , energy and external matters ...
russia , belarus and norway should be involved in this co-operation ...
interdisciplinary co-operation is necessary here , including in the european parliament committees ...
this macro region strategy for the baltic sea is a pilot project ...
the european institutions , in particular the european commission , should fulfil their role of providing coordination and support ...
nowadays , all the actors in our regions are affected by the crises ...
i supported this report ...
a properly coordinated eu region political may strengthen competitiveness and employment in the eu's regions ...
our smes , which make up 99 % of europe's productive tissue , need freedom from bureaucracy ...
the european eu and its member states are facing a major finance , economic and social crises ...
these measures can be financed by the payment committee of the european social fund ...
i join the rapporteur in emphasising the particular importance of goal this is vital for facilitating the convergence of all the european regions ...
this report focuses on the contribution of eu region political to resolving the economic crises ...
the objectives of the eu 2020 strategy must also be a driving force behind this issue ...
this is a guideline which frames and enhances the eu 2020 strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth ...
cohesion political , through the structural funds and other actions , is of prime importance ...
territorial cohesion helps boost the competitiveness of the various regions so as to make them as attractive as possible ...
it also provides the perfect conditions for entrepreneurship and developing smes ...
the aim is to mobilise the resources and tools required for granting finance support at local and region level ...
the positive response to combating the finance and economic crises has shown the importance of eu region political ...
i fully welcome this report ...
i abstained from voting on the report ...
however , I have my misgivings about the fixation on competitiveness that pervades the document ...
this is to be done within the region political budgetary framework ...
no proper impact assessments have been transported out in this regard ...
they currently overlap one other , resulting in a lack of clarity ...
it is important that these instruments are not solely used as fire fighting speeches ...
implementation of cohesion political programmes should be sped up in order to help these regions at this time ...
however , it seemed preferred to me to abstain on amendments all of this had to do with a voting at second reading ...
very many bus service in ireland are run by local transporters , small businesses and family businesses ...
rural bus service are vital to rural living ...
passengers should not suffer because of this proposal , either because of more restricted service or highest prices ...
i support this regulation concerning passengers rights in bus and coach transport ...
the persistence of varying levels of passengers protection depending on the form of transport being used is intolerable ...
i therefore voted in favour of the report on passengers rights in bus and coach transport ...
the member states unfortunately work hand in glove with the transport operators , and oppose stronger passengers rights ...
we note that the approved changes also improve on the previous version , by guaranteeing , in particular 
that transporters need to heed the appropriate access conditions for persons with disabilities and those with restricted mobility 
these service should also be accessible to persons with disabilities 
bus passengers cannot and must not be the only ones not to be protected by a eu regulation ...
i voted in favour and I congratulate mr cancian on his report , which I feel is in-depth ...
in most cases , in fact , bus transport is operated by small enterprises ...
i therefore fully support mr cancian's proposal and his very well balanced approach ...
journeys have been considerably democratised in recent years , and we have to be happy about that ...
i voted in favour of the cancian report concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport ...
now we go into conciliation ...
therefore , we have voted in favour ...
in writing ... the concerns with the report voted are the follows 
in several of the amendments , responsibilities of compliance are addressed to the port authorities ...
i also appreciate the fact that exceptional circumstances were adopted into account in this report ...
even if these circumstances stay exceptional , they can pose serious problems to travellers when they arise ...
this report also aims to facilitate assistance , retransportation , reimbursement and compensation for passengers in such circumstances ...
all of this had to do with a voting at second reading ...
it is crucial that consumers are given effective rights to ensure that liberalisation allows for real choice ...
i would love to item out that safety conditions cannot be neglected and made relative in any circumstances ...
the complaints system should be accessible and clear to passengers ...
combating exclusion is a priority for the eu ...
i therefore believe that the rights of passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility should be firmly guaranteed ...
in writing ......... the new rights afforded to passengers on boats and ships are to be welcomes .........
this means that there requirements to be investment in terminals and ports ...
these passengers should also have the opportunity to submit compensation claims ...
in this cases , too , it is primarily about accommodating persons with particular requirements ...
however , we do not consider european legislation to be the right instrument for protecting passengers rights ...
the netherlands itself is better placed to make tailored political ...
this compelled us to voting against this proposal ...
for these reasons , I voted in favour of the amendments tabled to the council's position ...
as is the cases with the airlines industry , passengers merit to be protected against disruption ...
consumer rights must be protected ...
this legislation is heading in the right directorate , giving more rights to passengers travelling by boat or coach ...
passengers on marine transport will have rights analogous to those stipulated in european legislation for aeroplane and train passengers ...
i welcome the adoption of the regulation concerning trip by sea and inland waterways ...
i hope that an acceptable compromise can be achieved in conciliation ...
in order to solve growing road infrastructures problems , there are motions to deploy advanced information and communication technologies ...
the effectiveness of using information and communications technologies in the sphere of road transport is indisputable ...
the correct functioning of the internal market must be ensured ...
i voted for this document , because it would accelerate the implementation of smart transport system solutions ...
the approval of this draft legislative resolution is an important step towards deploying smart transport systems ...
if smart trafficking systems are actually implemented , they must be inter-operable ...
some thought was also given to mutual appreciation and information protection , therefore why I am giving my approval ...
in writing ......... the greens / efa have supported the jensen recommendations onintelligent transport systems.........
the agreement with the council was adopted and the directive has been finalised at second reading ...
i am happy that it was adopted with a resounding majority ...
thus , the formalities required by eu legislation should be simplified and harmonised ...
creating a large european transport area without barriers is essential ...
in writing ......... the verts / ale group supported the sterckx report on formalities for ships at seaports .........
the agreement with the council was thus adopted and the directive has been finalised at prime reading ...
the eu airlines industry is already in terrible straits ...
better performance and highest environmental standards are being sought in this report ...
in my opinion , definite targets must be set if significant results are to be achieved ...
transport is accountable for 25 % of co2 emissions in europe ...
it is crucial to have cleaner vehicles and more efficient transport systems in order to reduce this impact ...
the reality is a bit different , however ...
there is not far evidence of collective aspiration ...
the transport sector is of great importance in the european internal market ...
this sector effectively enables the free movement of persons and products throughout the eu ...
i would therefore love to item out that the decarbonisation of transport should be a priority ...
in this context , it is value noting the opportunity of internalising external costs ...
the grosch report is an splendid starting item as we await the european commission white document ...
the report calls for safest , more efficient transport which reasons less pollution ...
in other words , nothing but very conventional and very obvious things ...
nowadays's voting calls for more joined up thinking throughout the whole of europe ...
i endorsed the final version of the report ...
instead of making the fund more flexible , we have obtained a fund which has no flexibility at all ...
i would love to thank the fellow members who voted to dismiss amendments transport has a multifunctional character , with directly influences on economic , social and territorial matters ...
i voted for this report because I support the aim of european transport policies ...
i am voting against this report ...
it also contributes to the developmental and consolidation of the internal market ...
we are as far away as ever from achieving sustainability in transport ...
this report is basically almost a rehash of old , unfulfilled strategies ...
that is why I abstained ...
the european economy , and therefore employment , depends on the sustainable future of transport ...
the verts / ale group voted in favour ...
we support the resolution despite the risks posed by overly extremists stances already adopted by parliament ...
we must balance the need to protect the environment with the present economic crises we are experiencing ...
we look favourably on the heavy-duty emphasis on safety ...
this report will affect a forthcoming green document on an integrated transport political ...
i voted against the report , as it advocates the total liberalisation of transport political ...
unfortunately , however , the finances allocated to this sector are inadequate ...
this is why I voted against amendments however , the impacts of the finance crises on the transport sector should not be overlooked ...
there is more to transport than merely trucks , trafficking and tariffs ...
it also boosts employment ...
i was happy to hear the results of nowadays's voting ...
the grosch report has proposed the achievement of unusually ambitious objectives by 20i ca not , however , agree with one of the rapporteur's motions ...
i have misgivings about the proposal to create a transport fund ...
parliament is directly elected by the public ...
this allows an assessment to be made of the impact of european legislation on the everyday lives of citizens ...
i believe that it is vital to create incentive for greater participation ...
it is clear that european legislation has a directly impact on the public ...
i voted in favour of the annual report by the committee on petitions ...
thus , the outcome ca have been better ...
this is therefore an instrument of democratic and citizenship ...
i do have one small regret that french citizens make very little use of this procedure ...
according to the report , 46 % of submitted petitions in 2009 were deemed unacceptable ...
this is far too high a number ...
petitions are important because they give the european parliament a means to connect with its constituencies and vice versa ...
these objectives must be maintained through sustained efforts from both member states and the european commission ...
this own initiative report aimed to identify the present difficulties and to propose some solutions ...
as I am completely in agreement with these objectives , I voted in favour of this report ...
of course , this is not just a question of affirming these objectives loud and clearly ...
my amendments to the text were inserted in this vein ...
in actual figures , this means that nearly 6 millions young persons are currently unemployed ...
the only possible outcome from this is a needless lengthy mandate burden shouldered by european and domestic budget ...
it is up to member states to invest in work establishment at political and economic level ...
other social and economic risks and costs to our societies are associated with this pre eminent issue of youth unemployed ...
i feel that we cannot be resigned to losing young europeans to social exclusion ...
it is intolerable that some member states are planning a lower minimum salary for young persons ...
the economic crises has , of course , also resulted in highest unemployed in the european eu ...
the impact of this has been heaviest on young persons and persons approaching the age of retirement ...
unemployed among young persons is a enormous issue ...
mrs turunen's report is the prime step , and I fully support it ...
youth unemployed is one of the most pressing problems facing europe ...
at the same time , the eu must be united when it comes to common strategies ...
a coherent mix of educational , finance , social and employment policies is required ...
that is why we abstained ...
persons under 25 are the prime to be affected by the present economic crises ...
it is certainly important to tighten the regulations on internships ...
the representatives of the german free democratic party in the european parliament have supported this ...
this is an unsustainable situation ...
internships should not destroy jobs ...
we believe that this gives a bad message ...
it should yet be possible to do a three month unpaid internship , for example ...
there are numerous non profit making or social organizations where a young person can acquire exciting , interesting experiences ...
however , such organizations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship ...
the key factor should be the duration of an internship ...
from then on , remuneration should also be paid ...
the decision made nowadays is impracticable and applies too far ...
we therefore do not support this part of the resolution ...
young persons should not stay unemployed more than four months this is a statement with which I agree ...
youth unemployed is one of europe's most pressing problems ...
all member states must adopt action and fight youth unemployed by taking domestic specificities into account ...
we must ensure growth and create new jobs , especially for young persons and prioritise business educational provider co-operation ...
i voted nowadays for the own initiative report on combating youth unemployed ...
by adopting this report , we have decided to adopt strong action against the abuse of internships ...
the commission and member states were asked by parliament to recommend minimum standards for internships ...
a european quality charter on internships is to be proposed ...
i am therefore in favour of promoting the statute of internships ...
this sends out a clear signal to our young europeans ...
we often say that young persons are the future of europe ...
it is awful that the youth unemployed rate is double the average european rate ...
unfortunately , the outlook is not hopeful either ...
unemployed among young persons is one of europe's most pressing problems ...
that is why I voted as I did ...
it is mainly young persons and women who are affected by unemployed ...
this tendency continues to grow during the downturn ...
the actual process of getting on the work ladder is becoming increasingly difficult ...
unsafe jobs mean that we should not be surprised at low births rates ...
let us attempt , with the council and the commission , to guarantee young persons a dignified salary ...
the crises has hit hardest at those who are just introduction the labour market ...
i have no doubt that unemployed among young persons is currently one of the eu's largest problems ...
even if young persons do find work , they are very often only given temporary contracts ...
internships are also the cause of far emotion ...
the european eu must have common strategies ...
this specific paragraph for the whole of europe has been added at a particularly difficult time for young persons ...
in an ideal world , youth unemployed would be outlawed ...
since 2000 , youth unemployed in brussels has never fallen below 30 % ...
that is the thrust of the turunen report ...
it sketches new ways to sidewalk youth unemployed ...
we must also ensure that these are of good quality ...
the report was adopted with a large majority in favour ...
it is fundamental for the europe of the future to guarantee full and secure employment for young persons ...
europe must have the courage to invest in those businesses which do not relocate but create jobs ...
vocational training is essential ...
there should be a quality charter to ensure that learning provide a sensible income and are of limited duration ...
addressing this is an important task for accountable politicians ...
with 21...4 % of young europeans under 25 unemployed , it is definitely time to adopt action ...
in lithuania , last annum , every 11th young person was unemployed compared to every twenty 4th in 200we need to boost youth employability by helping adapting educational skills to labour market requirements ...
support measures such as quality internships , learning and traineeships can aid a smooth transitional from educational to employment ...
for lithuania , it is vital to prevent an growing cerebral drain of skilled labour ...
i voted in favour of the gruny report , whose aim is to launch a vast european employment initiative ...
my contribution was based along two lines ...
firstly , the importance of the link between training course and the requirements of the labour market ...
it also promotes the view thatself employmentis the type of work that should be promoted ...
i am voting in favour of the bulk of the measures proposed in this report ...
these have a greater impact on young persons and women ...
the prime relates to the need for increased investment in skills and professional and lifelong training ...
these workers are often denied important rights including the right to training or to join a trade eu ...
the crises should not serve as a excuse for the developmental of more precarious employment ...
all workers should have access to equality treatment irrespective of their employment contract ...
i fully support the report and I will voting in favour of its adoption ...
rigid models of labour law have proven to have failed ...
society has evolved , the world has changed , and labour relations must inevitably accompany this change ...
a set of basic rights for all employees should be secured , irrespective of employment statute ...
i yet defender the urgent extension of protection to work undertaken in atypical forms of employment ...
the eu cannot abandon its european social model , but should rather strengthen it ...
many of the report's articles are an example of this , namely , when it says that it 
unemployed persons and workers must not expect a welcome from brussels quite the contrary !
the crises must not serve as a excuse for the developmental of casual work ...
all employees must be protected by labour law , whatever form their contract takes ...
nowadays's labour market and its associated employment relationships are characterised by one word flexicurity ...
i therefore support mrs gruny's report ...
i nowadays voted in favour of the gruny own initiative report on atypical employment contracts in the eu ...
this allows us to send out two clear messages to the labour market ...
atypical employment contracts must stay the exception in europe ...
the transitional must be made to stable , protected , better quality employment contracts ...
the fast pace of structural change necessitates more flexible forms of working ...
the abuse of atypical employment breaches the european social model ...
dialogue and collective negotiation can contribute greatly to improving and preserving the labour market ...
the report adopts well defined guidelines and specific measures for safeguard jobs , ensuring high quality employment throughout europe ...
the european eu is facing a major finance , economic and social crises ...
in writing ......... the report as adopted in committee has been adopted in plenary .........
the text is not damaging but relatively weak ...
there was , unfortunately , no chance to secure a majority for it ...
the incidence of atypical employment contracts is growing significantly in the european eu ...
the analysis presented in the gruny report is therefore good and to be welcomes ...
we therefore go further in our alternative resolution ...
there must not be two classes of employment contract ...
that resolution did not make it , and parliament passed up an opportunity to construct a stronger social europe ...
action is certainly desirable , therefore , and so I welcome the position of the whole european parliament ...
this is important ...
nevertheless , I believe that the eu should not involve itself in the forms of employment ...
this is a matter that must instead be dealt with at a domestic level ...
in my home country , collective agreements to agreement with these matters are negotiated by autonomous parties ...
growing resource efficiency in europe is among the priority objectives of the eu 2020 strategy ...
allow me to give you one example of this ...
biogas is a precious resource used to produce electricity and fuel for transport and for supplying the gas network ...
bio waste has a role to play in a more global matter the fight against climate change ...
we must therefore totally separate bio waste from standard waste , which is the worst solution in the lengthy mandate ...
instead , we should use it for composting or for production bioenergy , as the report strongly emphasises ...
finally , there is a great diversity between the member states in terms of the present management of bio waste ...
in order to managing bio waste effectively , the priority should be waste prevention or reduction ...
effective bio waste management can contribute to the eu target of at least 20 % renewable energy by 20selective collection and recycling of bio waste is essential to europe's sustainable developmental ...
the new legislation should prescribe the requirement for a system of selective bio waste collection and recycling ...
treatment of waste is a issue that affects europe and all of humanity ...
firstly , I would love to congratulate the rapporteur , mr fernandes , for his splendid work ...
present legislation in terms of bio waste does not answer the requirements of the material's regulation ...
efficient management of bio waste not only brings environmental benefits but also contributes favourably to the social and economic areas ...
i am therefore voting in favour of this report's motions ...
ever greater areas are experiencing irreparable soil degradation here ...
globally , bio waste is most often put in landfills and only a tiny percentage is classified and reprocessed ...
europeans now understand the need to sort waste ...
however , bio waste almost always ends up in landfills ...
the report deals with the issue adequately , and I will voting in favour of its adoption ...
it is estimated that the amount of bio waste produced in the eu every annum is around 100 millions tons ...
our position is ambitious and realistic ...
although we broadly agree with these principles , we cannot , however , neglect to item out some problems ...
the question unanswered in the report is who will pay ?
reduction is one of the better ways of combating problems related to waste ...
as regards composting , it is not enough to say that we need to do it ...
the satisfying management of bio waste would therefore have not only environmental benefits , but also economic ones ...
action must be adopted at the eu level and nowadays's voting should ensure that progress is made ...
this report takes the right approach ...
i will therefore abstain ...
bio waste can also be reused to produce bio energy and biofuels ...
the recycling industry currently creates around 250 jobs for each 10 000 tons of waste recycling ...
one strategic goal of waste management political is to transform the eu into a recycling society ...
this means that sustainable developmental can be promoted through efficient resource management ...
in writing ......... the draft report already contained the most relevant issues for us greens .........
this was included in the recitals of the text adopted in committee ...
we are in favour of the commission's green document on the management of bio waste ...

economic governance in the eu and the eurozone , and surveillance of domestic budget debate 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , economic governance constitutes a crucial challenge for the future of our eu ...
commissioner olli rehn then discussed this with you during his hearing ...
unfortunately , the crises has shown that we were right ...
as a result , the commission provided detailed motions on 12 may ...
these motions do not involve changing the treaty ...
we must act now , within the legal context that we have nowadays ...
this is not a limitation ...
our citizens , our businesses and our economy are demanding that we adopt initiatives ...
it is our responsibility to decide and to act now ...
because of the economic crises , the european eu has been faced with a series of serious tests ...
as I said this morning , a agreement is within reach in the coming day ...
our response to the crises is a holistic one ...
we stabilise , we consolidate and we modernise ...
we prepare our social market economy to ensure a better future for our citizens ...
but for now , let me focus on governance ...
we have the treaty arrangements in place which allow us to act ...
we have the institutions ...
we need to make it work ...
we faced a real risk and we successfully withstood it ...
now we are filling in the gaps we have identified to pre empt such risks for the future ...
i prime announced to parliament the ideas we fleshed out in the commission communication of 12 may ...
our debates since then are reflected in the commission communication of 30 june ...
this work has helped to build a real european momentum ...
i hope that this will translate later into a swift consideration and swift adoption of legislative motions ...
our approach to economic governance is to have rules that are more comprehensive and more efficient ...
we need a stronger surveillance system ...
what does this mean in details ?
prime , we need more coordination ...
key to this is theeuropean semester...
it will improve economic transparency and encourage peer reviews , ex ante , among member states ...
second , we need the credibility that comes with better implementation ...
this means a refined incentive and sanctions toolkit , a more effective mix of both preventive and corrective action ...
i wanna to be very clear on this ...
parliament can be reassured that the commission will do its utmost to ensure that this will be the cases ...
the timing of measures is also key ...
we must not fall into the trap of waiting too lengthy before sanctions lower in ...
incentive and sanctions must be brought upstream so that action is deployed before the situation gets out of hand ...
preventive action can be far more effective than corrective action but it requires discipline and political will ...
we are addressing this in our motions , in particular , as regards the euro area ...
third , our surveillance requirements to capture all the key elements ...
it must not be restricted to fiscal political alone ...
we have seen that such a narrow perspective does not work ...
we must have tools to detect macro economic imbalances among member states ...
such imbalances weaken the cohesion of the eu and , in particular , of the euro area ...
a comprehensive dashboard of indicators will give us what we need to identify growing divergences and to propose remedies ...
they need , of course , to be complemented by appropriate implementation mechanisms for such remedies ...
that is what our europe 2020 strategy is all about ......... the european council endorsed it a fortnight ago .........
i would love to underline the historic dimensions of the reforms we are putting forward ...
this is a strategy for the whole eu ......... this is not just an addition of different strategies .........
applause 
president barroso , commissioner rehn , your motions are an important step towards strengthen economic governance in europe ...
it also desires to cooperate on taking the next step towards the community method ...
we have great expectations of the european semester and the coordination of domestic action programmes ...
important reforms and painful measures in the member states are necessary in order to strengthen their competitiveness ...
this will create jobs and prosperity for our citizens ...
you called the series of measures atoolbox...
a great agreement will depend on the specific content of this toolkit ...
one of our dutch soccer computers has the mottodeeds not words...
fiscal stability cannot exists in isolation from strong economic growth and high levels of employment ...
in your motions of last week , I think you are missing the item ...
you have left out several highly relevant options that would really mean a qualitative leap in this field ...
second , you must come forward with an economic political agenda for jobs and fiscal consolidation ...
nowadays , we only have an agenda for cutting deficits at the detriment of jobs ...
taxation on labour is far too high in a number of member states ...
i hope you will reconsider and come forward with a more balanced set of motions in the autumn ...
the commission has the initiative here ...
nevertheless , mr president , some issues stay concerning this package ...
the prime question , which is fundamental , is who will managing this economic governance ?
we cannot just say that we will reduce the deficits ...
the 4th element is thestress tests...
i am satisfied with the fact that the decision has been adopted to publish these ...
this is a crucial item ...
furthermore , this element is repeated in the commission's motions ...
the member states have not yet understood ...
mr president , many acknowledgements for making this statement ...
it also specifically refers imbalances ...
until recently , it was yet almost impossible to talk about imbalances severely ...
this clearly means economic governance and also talking about tax issues ...
these must stop being taboo topics and clearly have a place in such a statement ...
secondly , it is not enough to coordinate budgetary political only in the way it was described ...
we must ensure that budgetary political is anti- cyclical , enabling it therefore to counteract crises ...
unfortunately , this does not feature in the text ...
unfortunately , you are yet lacking the courage to explain things as clearly as is necessary ...
we have problems with asset prices and bubbles ...
this is not mentioned explicitly either ...
it is no longer enough now to make progress in this crises ...
we need to arrive at consensus ...
the outcome requirements to be fully implemented by all 27 member states and be fully complied with ...
the recent finance and economic crises has necessitated bold measures ...
i do not agree with this conclude ...
both the commission and council are calling for further controls and penalties for member states in deficit ...
this has not worked in the past and will not work in the future ...
regulation of the finance markets is a matter of urgency ...
we will do our part to resolve the situation ...
europe's citizens already have to pay the council now ought finally to swing into action as well ...
this may stall growth in the euro area , which is yet feeble and at risk ...
these countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead ...
what is necessary is to carry out a fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its conditions ...
i think you had an urgent appointment ...
you are in such a pumpkin actually , are you not ?
what in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually tore up your own rule book ...
you threw it away !
i am not a johnny come lately to the demise of the euro ...
it was always writing in the runes , as it were ...
to suggest now that we have only just found out that greece was broke is intellectually unfair ...
our commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible issue because they buy junk debt ...
they redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple a ratings ...
what are our central banks doing now ?
the very same thing ...
you had promised the convergence and the harmonisation of the european countries ...
nowadays , you are rushing us towards a social and political explosion ...
errare humanum est , perseverare diabolicum to err is human , to persist is of the devil ...
prime of all , to corien wortmann kool , thank you for your support ...
that is precisely our goal with youth 20so our proposal is not only about prudence in macro economic aspects ...
that is why I also do not agree with the idea that our approach is not balanced ...
we will come with formal motions ...
what is going on is a very important reform ...
but we also wanna to includes in this holistic approach macro economic surveillance with tif ...
it is not only about sanctions for those who do not fulfil the criteria of depth and the deficit ...
we will also attempt to reinforce coordination in terms of the macro economic imbalances ...
we need this since our whole reform is based on this new architecture ...
in the last few day , a new belgian presidency has renewed momentum towards a agreement ...
there is a predominant sense of constructive pragmatism on both sides ...
i am grateful for the aspiration parliament has been demonstrating ...
i am grateful for your strong support ...
i believe it now appears within grasp ...
the commission has contributed through various compromise texts and is very happy that progress is being made ...
we now call on both colegislators to maintain the positive dynamic ...
president obama said in the g20 that he got a bipartisan agreement ...
great , and we welcome that ...
finally , some of you talked about stress test ...
at the last european council , I made a strong plea to make the results public ...
a fully transparent stress testing provides the opportunity to do so ...
so , as you see , we are acting on several fronts ...
i believe that the stability of the euro is in the interest of all our citizens ...
applause 
president barroso , thank you for your approach and for your co-operation with the european parliament ...
the debate is closed ...
writing statements rule 149 
in writing ......... I welcome the motions made by the commission .........
europe is about mutual and close interdependency ...
however , control mechanisms are not a solution but just a means ...
they should not be overestimated ...
the solution is in more efficient work , entrepreneurship and innovation ...
the key to the solution is prevention ...
particular care should be paid to budgetary frameworks and the state debts ...
instead of breaking finance control into smaller clusters , monitoring of the macro economic situation as a whole is necessary ...
the new dual system of incentive and sanctions deserves support ...
i also encourage making better use of eurostat ...
reliable and timely information is a crucial component to making the right rulings ...
i should love to draw fellow membersattention to the issue of domestic budgeting ...
this is all the result of illogical and unclear tax legislation ...
in individual cases , tax authority personnel can apply thisturbidlegislation in any way they choose ...
this has led to the bankruptcy of many businesses and commercial structures ...
what is occurring in the tax sphere in latvia nowadays can be described in one word illegality !
in essence , the state is depriving entrepreneurs of their liquid funds ...
the next item is the joint debate on the follows 
rapporteur ......... mr president , at the origin of this finance crises are the domestic overseers .........
at this stage , and with the enormous crises we are suffering , there are only two possibilities ...
the british splits the main finance regulator and gives more power and more clout to the bank of england ...
mr osborne said that it had failed to prevent the crises because no one knew who was in charge ...
to close my speech , this is not time for a debate on a second order reform ...
applause 
the trialogues began the follows day ...
when including this item in this plenary sitting , we had anticipated completing the negotiating process by this dated ...
as colegislators , we need to continue making an effort , as this agreement is yet possible ...
this sheets some margin for reaching a compromise at a prime reading within the next few weeks ...
it is not a cases , therefore , of a regular , generalised review ...
the commission has been given the necessary powers to ensure its adoption within the anticipated timeframe ...
all competences and powers have been incorporated into the sectoral legislation ...
i hope that the negotiations on this directive can be brought to a satisfying conclude ...
parliament has the follows message , which is supported by a large , overall majority ...
since then , we have had a wide ranging debate about many issues ...
they also would have expected these authorities to be granted strong investor and consumer protection rights ...
this is the decision we have come to now in parliament ...
there also seems , fortunately , to be a broad consensus that this step is necessary ...
we also insisted in parliament on the new authorities receiving rights enabling them to ban risky finance products ...
this was other cases where we had to fight against the suggestions being irrigated down ...
the key item remains if a real finance crises pauses out , who declare the emergency ?
will the council ever do this ?
it is insisting that the fox should be put in charge of the henhouse ...
this does not make any sense , a fact which the commission has also continually pointed out ...
so far , the council appears rigid ...
it must be a cases of large amounts being allocated by means of a decision at european level ...
it is now over to the council ...
since then , the commission has done its work ...
it commissioned a report from jack de larosière ...
prime , there are the issues concerning efficiency ...
we do not need a safeguard clause ...
on this question , I would nevertheless love to make a comment ...
who do the member states wanna to protect themselves from when they plan safeguard clauses against europe ?
we also wanna these authorities to be located in a single place , for reasons of efficiency ...
on this matter , we have also made some requests ...
we have also asked for greater openness from these bodies ...
i would love to say one final word relating to the united states ...
i am always shocked when persons tell us that the americans have pulled ahead ...
i also notice that a number of governments are having discussions in two stages ...
prime , we refuse any federal state ...
we refuse any new stage of integration and we decry the community method ...
then , later , we always compare ourselves to the united states ...
there comes a time when we have to abide by our responsibilities ...
i wanna a stronger europe ...
madam president , cassandra had a gift that of eloquent the future ...
she also bore a curse that of not being listened to ...
for this reason , troy fell ...
they can only be supervised by european authorities ...
we did not adopt heed of this , and the crises erupted ...
exotic products , unidentified even to their creators , flooded the markets ...
nobody trusted anybody else , nobody lent to anybody else , and credit dried up ...
now what ?
parliament has given a great agreement of ground in order to reach an agreement the commission too ...
the belgian presidency has shown great willing ...
it has asked us for time ...
there are several ideas that parliament would love to highlight ...
what does it mean to say that they are european ?
domestic overseers cannot be feudal lords inverted with absolute power ...
this governs everything except systemic institutions ...
canoes should be made ready before the voyage , not in the middle of a thunderstorm ...
what cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again ...
the council has asked for time ...
parliament has given it time ...
let nobody be confused , however this is not a sign of weakness ...
this is a sign of the strength of this house ...
it must not make use of this time to attempt and put together blocking minority in opposition to parliament ...
i ask the council to listen to cassandra for once ...
nowadays , cassandra is the draftsmen who have talked ...
cassandra is also commissioner barnier ...
those who are not cassandra know only too well to whom I refer ...
listen to parliament , seek an agreement , say here what was said in toronto ...
do not say one thing here and other there ...
god and this house ...
it remains the most comprehensive piece of sectoral finance service legislation voted on in this parliament ...
as such , creditworthiness ii is intimately linked with the motions for eiopa ...
it is perhaps because of my experience with creditworthiness ii that I was keen to adopt on this report ...
i knew that it was the context in which we ca make creditworthiness ii really work ...
insurance is not banking and I am glad that my fellow draftsmen have accepted that ...
they will not be different but they will be balanced ...
this is a real win for parliament ...
for pension , the question is up in the air ...
we need to attribute wider powers of interference to the overseers ...
we need to prepare contingency plans ...
this entire process takes time for 27 member states ...
however , around 50 of the 12 000 banks operating europe represent 70 % of assets ...
this means an enormous concentration of risk , but also an opportunity to intervene primarily in them ...
as you well know , the latest trialogue actually took place yesterday evening ...
should the presidency of the esrb be elected , or should he or she be automatic the ecb president ?
should the president of the efc participate in the work of the esrb ?
there again , an agreement is not far away ...
i count on your support on these very important endeavours ...
there are many topics which are part of this architecture of prevention , crises management and supervision ...
there is also finance departmental governance and banking capital ...
i will come back to this when talking about mr karasreport ...
i would love to say a few words on the two topics for nowadays ...
prime , I will tackle supervision , which is effectively the backbone ...
we need this credible european architecture of supervision ...
we find here the spirit and the philosophy of the commission's motions ...
i am thinking of the reinforcement of the joint committee , as advocated by mr skinner ...
these are only a few examples the most difficult things yet lie ahead of us ...
i wanna to repeat what mr garcía margallo y marfil said ...
we need the council to understand that now is the time to act and to make progress ...
others have also said this ...
the ball is in its court to use these few day to reach an smart and credible agreement ...
you can count on me to be available ...
i have myself believed in precaution measures for a lengthy time ...
that is the spirit of the toolkit that we will be presenting to the council of ministers ...
i make the commitment that a legislative text will be presented to you ...
i would love to say that I am talking as the shadow rapporteur for the opinion ...
there have been different approaches adopted at domestic level ...
it is obvious that this cannot work ...
what citizens wanna is for an effective decision to be made to get problems resolved ...
the council only takes a narrow inclined approach ...
the public do not find this political acceptable ...
we expect the council to adopt action ...
this means he can issue warnings , make recommendations , and all of this in public ...
i really do regard this as an extremely positive move which should be highlighted ...
madam president , commissioners , european supervision of finance markets is the minimum that we can do ...
it will require the regulation of rating agencies ...
as a result , the issue of control has not been resolved the control must be political ...
it is also insufficient if we do not adopt real measures against the vol of capital to tax paradises ...
a regulation at the european level is useful , but insufficient ...
we must have global supervision of finance markets ...
we cannot simply allow things to carry on in this dysfunctional and incoherent manner ...
equally , the new european framework must radically improve both the quality and consistency of regulatory supervision ...
our member states are right to resist such a move ...
the british and germany are right to adopt the positions that they have ...
let us now begin the debate with the political group speakers ...
the issue has already been explain ...
we are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays ...
member states yet believe that they can use their domestic supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment ...
this is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the european parliament ...
as is well known , the european parliament is not an army of extremists making revolutionary demands ...
our motions are those of de larosière , not robespierre , as the fine commissioner barnier knows ...
friends in the council , even if you are not here , you will read our words ...
expensive friends in the council , do not bury your heads in the sable love ostriches ...
reality is tough , but it must be faced with choices of courage and strength ...
if they are toxic , why authorise them ?
it is clearly asking for mandatory actions ...
all of this does not seem to me to amount to extremism ...
i can think of no other name for that than a political federation ...
here lies the essence of the entire debate on finance architecture and the supervision of finance architecture ...
we have currency eu ...
the citizens sitting here and watching us may quite rightly ask so what is your solution ? 
we need to do something without giving you a say ... 
in my opinion , that is the bad approach ...
the council and the governments do not wanna strong interference rights ...
mr giegold is right when he described what is currently going on asparochial...
we will get a fragmentary supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the finance markets ...
this would be just the prime step to a statute quo ante ...
it is finally time for the grandiose promises to be supported up by actions ...
my group supports strong european regulation ...
i miracle , however , whether the road we are about to engage upon is the right one ...
finally , I am convinced that politics should adopt more responsibility ...
de madam president , the european eu already has around 40 eu agencies ...
every annum , these organizations gobble up eur 1...5 billion ...
the council and member states have never had any issue making quick fire rulings to establish such agencies ...
most of all , there is frequently no rationale given for these agencies ...
unfortunately , they often adopt a ludicrous stance ...
in this debate on european supervision , parliament has played this role ...
why is this ?
in these troubled time , the european systemic risk board must get to work as rapidly as possible ...
however , this is only a start ...
the unity of the european single market must also be supervised if we wanna to avoid its segmentation ...
they are also focusing more on substance than on a turf war ...
standardised derivatives will be traded on established exchanges and forced through clearing houses ...
we are discussing how to distribute the powers between european institutions and domestic institutions ...
well , the solution is quite easy ...
instead , monitoring should begin in our countries ...
in italy , for example , it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor cases well ...
furthermore , why should the headquarters of the european agency be in frankfurt ?
who decided that ?
it should also contribute to the emergence of a single banking market of the eu ...
i am glad that it appears that we are close to agreement ...
in retrospect , it seems astonishing that we did not have a single eu wide macro prudential body doing just this ...
i am extremely happy to see how close we are to a final agreement ...
we should all , and the draftsmen themselves , be very proud ...
de madam president , we need more supervision of the finance markets in europe too ...
the economic and finance crises has made it glaringly and painfully obvious that opportunities were missed in the past ...
the european finance supervisory authorities must be provided with extensive powers ...
they must not degenerate into vacuum shells which passively observe market developments ...
the council must finally accept the european parliament as a legislator of equality standing ...
there has certainly been no lack of preparatory work by the accountable meps ...
numerous discussions have adopted place and work has been transported out in parliament rapidly and purposefully ...
we are now waiting for the council to provide clear answers and concrete motions in writing ...
hu the crises has taught us all some painful lessons ...
the new supervisory authorities will serve exactly this purpose ...
parliament should also make concessions ...
finally , ecofin should be granted the right to announce an economic crises ...
fr madam president , I am happy to find my friend michel barnier in this chamber ...
i am thinking of international public banking establishments and , in particular , of the european investment bank ...
information which will be collected by those three institutions will be very important and will be partially confidential ...
we must do everything in our power so that this does not happen again ...
we need regulation and supervision ...
we need independence , strong authorities in the interest of europeans ...
what the united states has succeeded in doing , the european eu must also do ...
this is the only way open to us to change things , and this is why we must succeed ...
however , efforts to create stricter regulation and closer supervision will not , by themselves , prevent potential crises ...
we need more involvement from europe ...
the proposal tabled by the commission already provides a minimum scenario ...
we need strong supervision with teeth , a right of interference and a mediator function ...
we need rulings without further notice in emergencies ...
we require banking supervision as part of crises management ...
we need strong supervision with teeth ...
it is very good that the eu is not passive in ensuring finance security ...
let us remember to link the responsibility of the eu to the responsibility of all member states ...
these interference rights are restricted to absolutely exceptional cases and will fortunately never be used ...
we wanna to keep systemic risks permanently to a minimum ...
for the sake of taxpayers , we need more involvement from europe , not less ...
if they fail to perform , they have someone to answer to ...
that is a key message ...
i would love to conclude by say that I have no issue with institutions being based in frankfurt ...
after all , germany has been a better model of finance propriety than many others ...
the issue is that we ignore asset inflation ...
i will report all those matters to him which may concern him directly ...
mrs bowles reminded us of the need for early interference measures ...
i think that these are good ideas ...
we are indeed carrying out this reform for the citizens ...
this is very far a reform for the citizens ...
mrs lulling mentioned a item which is of interest to my fellow , olli rehn ...
mr klinz , I would love to thank you for the support that you are showing us ...
you reminded us of the importance of applying our rules properly ...
that must be embarked upon , mr giegold , well before we talk about a ban ...
i ca imagine an important coordination role for the authorities in this area ...
the council also accepted that the authorities may have such a role ...
mr baldassarre mentioned a worry that mr lehne also has concerning the powers of the authorities ...
this has to do with the trans-atlantic calibration that I sometimes mention ...
i am not worried about the energetic interaction between americans and europeans ...
at the moment , 80 % of finance exchanges adopt place on both sides of the atlantique ...
the other regions of the world are there , between the americans and the europeans ...
we therefore have the same road map ...
also , the last g20 was something of a follow up g20 , in my view ...
the americans adopted a different method from our own they adopted a global package ...
they will now need to open the drawers one by one to implementation these rulings ...
i think that there are real parallels between the americans and the europeans ...
we are not always using the same tools , and we will not always use the same methods ...
our banking areas are quite dissimilar ...
i would remind you that in europe , the banks finance between two thirds and three quarters of the economy ...
in the united states , it is the other way around ...
we do not always have the same banking structures ...
on this subject , we are having a confident dialogue with the americans , but one without naïvety ...
that is what I would say in conclude , and I thank you for your speeches ...
in my cases , I ca argue that spain would probably have had a big corralito ...
the euro was created 11 years ago ...
i believe that we should make use of the time and reach a speedy agreement ...
those who advocated self regulation in the past now need to accept self financing ...
they have done an splendid work , which has not yet borne fruits ...
it is a pity therefore that my fellow members are no longer present ...
however , one thing which is also important to me is this compromise which we are now production ...
parliament tabled a last minutes compromise last week ...
it does not work if an inch being given ultimately results in a mile being adopted ...
this method will fail ...
i hope that this signal is also clearly understood by the absent council ...
otherwise , we are all going to find it very uncomfortable next week ...
mr president , commissioner , I would love to say three things ...
let us be quite clear ...
we have made an effort ...
this parliament agreed to interrupt the procedure of prime reading ...
this should not end up as cherry picking ...
no ...
i cannot mention all of them ...
this is our line this is what we believe in for reasons of efficiency ...
my second remark has to do with the dated ...
it is 1 january with good reason ...
we have the advantage that we anticipated things that other institutions said later ...
the president cut off the orator 
he repliedno , it's far more serious than that...
i would love to thank everybody who has participated in this ...
we have converged from different directions but we have come out with a strong parliament voice ...
we should be proud ...
on an international level , we should be proud too ...
however , I do not inevitably agree with you on international finance accountancy ...
you will not be surprised to hear that ...
i do not agree with using historic trends ...
nevertheless , on supervision , the draftsmen merit a pat on the back ...
we have gone through full time , we are now in additional time ...
let us hope it does not have to go to a penalty shoot out ...
i will attempt to be very brief here in stressing just four points ...
a particular mention for the office staff , for susanna vravova , and for the service of the committee ...
the joint debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place tomorrow , wed , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 ...
writing statements rule 149 
the european eu has a political , social and moral duty to intervene ...
that duty concludes its justification in the values underlying the eu and enshrined in the treaties ...
the economy can only function with healthy finance markets dedicated to it ...
european finance stability facility and european finance stabilisation mechanism and future actions debate 
we are the devils that look at the details , and we wanna more of it ...
on 11 may , the european stabilisation mechanism was established utilising the eu budgetary ...
a bit more haste would have been useful , and perhaps cheaper ...
can you confirm that the rules of the spv are being changed to permit this ?
there stay many other issues ...
how will the coordination between the stabilisation fund and the imf operate ?
is this all the right way around ?
should the imf be topping up an eu rescue , or should it be the other way round ?
is the spv active now or must prime calls use the eu budgetary mechanism ?
market forces are not popular right now ...
mrs bowles mentioned angels ...
i do not know if there are many angels when we talk of finance service ...
the prime question what amount are we talking about when we talk of this european stabilisation mechanism ?
what is the link with the ceiling on own resources ?
that is the precise response that mr rehn wanted to give to you on this item ...
the second question will the commission carry out an impact analysis for these two instruments ?
this report will be transmitted to the economic and finance committee and the council ...
notably , it will includes an impact assessment of the text ...
the third question what is the impact on the finance capabilities of the eib ?
it will not lend or borrow on name of this mechanism ...
no accurate choice of legal basis has yet been made ...
you have just mentioned the question of the role of the european parliament ...
the european parliament will be kept informed of any change regarding all of these new procedures ...
the sixth question what is the coordination with the international monetary fund ?
the 8th and final question relates to the choice of legal bases ...
this would have been difficult to reconcile with a lengthy procedure involving an important role for some domestic parliaments ...
however , I wish to say the follows on the subject ...
in our view , the finance stabilisation mechanism is not a substitute for developing a european monetary fund ...
the finance stabilisation mechanism illustrates the urgency of finance market reforms ...
in the meantime , the markets have done their work ...
our fellow member , mr karas , talked of the stability pact ...
nowadays , we have a mechanism that was put together in an emergency , as you reminded us ...
we did this in an emergency ...
the president cut off the orator 
this is a good course of action ...
thank you for your understanding ...
we now move on to the speakers in the catch the eye procedure ...
besides , the issue arises concerning the dependency of rating agencies ...
i find , therefore , that this measure has not been thought through well enough ...
it poses the risk again of member states running up debts at the detriment and liability of others ...
i believe that this is the quid of stabilisation ...
any reduction of this programme would be totally counterproductive ...
would you have a suggestion to make on this ?
i would simply love to ask you a question , commissioner ...
he will do this in writing in the next few day ...
i refer you to the quite comprehensive response that president barroso provided on this question ...
however , this is only a tool , mr karas ...
these ideas will also be rotated into legislative motions at the end of 2010 and the start of 20mrs berès mentioned the implementation of the stability pact ...
love you , I think that we must go further ...
as you have understood , we introduced this european finance stabilisation mechanism in a time of emergency ...
the commission has also made important motions relating to budgetary surveillance ...
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place on wed , 7 july 2010 at 12 00 ...
the next item is the joint debate on 
it will force banks to hold more capital against riskier activities on the trade book ...
we are constantly told by the banks that they have learned the lessons of the crises ...
it is therefore imperative that these rules on bonuses apply in 20colleagues , we have a duty , as legislators , to defend the taxpayersinterest ...
we have a duty to respond to the public's concerns ...
our voters demand and expect banks to prioritise stability and lending over bankersown pay and bonuses ...
in the last two years , since 2008 , the banks have failed to reform their structures ...
to begin with , it is important to exercise and expand sound internal and external supervision of remuneration policies ...
the remuneration itself must reflect the company's lengthy mandate performance as far as possible ...
bonuses should not just be guaranteed ...
a percentage of variable remuneration should be paid out over a sufficient duration ...
i think that we can go even further in this matter ...
i agree with your observation , mr el khadraoui ...
there must be mandatory measures on the remuneration policies of finance institutions ...
the payments of bonuses to guiding of banks receiving state aid is greatly restricted ...
i think that that is fair ...
i also welcome the fact that these measures must be implemented by the member states from 1 january 20this is one of the key elements of a more robust and more stable regulatory framework ...
i have begun this task ...
i recently put forward an international agenda for a finance regulation for growth ...
this is one of the requests made in your report , mr el khadraoui ...
we shall open a two month duration of genuine consultation on all these issues ...
thirdly , there is the matter of the modernisation of capital treatment ...
i have just referred to crd three and the issue of remuneration ...
i am very aware of this risk ...
i am aware that these negotiations on crd three have sometimes been very difficult ...
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the council is again absent ...
during the negotiations , the council came out on the side of the bonus recipients ...
the european parliament is in favour of clear european regulations ...
we are in favour of maximum limitations ...
we are in favour of payments methods involving less risk ...
we are in favour of liability ...
we are in favour of restrictions on bonuses for administrators of banks supported with public funds ...
we do not wanna species amounts to be highest than the tied up capital ...
we have managed to get our way with splitting the timetable ...
it is also important that we have tailored the trade book and banking book ...
we support this compromise as it takes us further in the right directorate ...
on the other hand , there have been very few specific measures ...
this legislation will most likely reduce the short sighted and exaggerated risk taking in the finance sector ...
that will reduce the risk level and increase stability ...
it is too risky for society to largely accept the statute quo ...
yes , I mean up there alongside the supervisory architecture ...
madam president , commissioner , my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted ...
it is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors ...
i must say , commissioner , that the commission has largely been on our side in this struggle ...
therefore , I think that this is an achievement which we can share ...
now , there is an important issue at stake ...
as we lost , we have had to make compromises ...
we have here a regulation which is unique on a global scale ...
after all , any administrators who are successful and accountable also wanna to continue making a good living ...
this is a fundamental change towards greater sustainability and cost efficiency , and fortunately away from gaming ...
thank you to all fellow members for their co-operation on this report ...
it is clear that we need principles that promote and create guidelines for a sound remuneration political ...
at the same time , we must avoid broad generalisations and blaming the sector as a whole ...
in the end , we succeeded in achieving a relatively balanced result ...
de madam president , mr karas has already mentioned some key points ...
i fully concur with him on them ...
i think that we need better capital requirements for finance institutions in both qualitative and quantitative terms ...
however , it does not help to force the situation as this ca have totally the contrary effect ...
the finance crises is clearly a global crises ...
the lessons we need to draw from it must therefore be attracted at a global level as well ...
this means that if we tighten capital requirements , we must coordinate this measure internationally too ...
the level playing field must be retained ...
calculation examples in the annex must also match the formulation ...
however , the future supervisory authority will be accountable for the interpretation ...
there is one other thing we should not forget ...
the finance economy and the real economy are not two self contained systems ...
it will not be that easy to put an end to this ...
the attempt to make management executives more accountable with retentions was thwarted by new insurance policies ...
the eu draft should draw a lesson from this ...
the factors determining the bonuses must definitely be transparent ...
madam president , I would love to thank the draftsmen and the commission ...
we only know about the exaggerations of the banking sector because of the disaster that have happened ...
transparency is the key to all of this ...
when persons have expertise of what is occurring , then we can adopt action on it ...
clear rules have been implemented which cannot be construed in different ways ...
this is the aim of the debates we are having with the council at this very moment ...
this includes , mr canfin , rulings on rules relating to remuneration ...
i should now love to say a few words about the implementation of these new rules ...
they must apply to all investment banking firms ...
mr christensen , you emphasized the need for transparency ...
mrs bowles mentioned the central issue of capitalisation , as did mr balz a short while ago ...
capitalisation is indeed important ...
we need to achieve exactly the same objectives ...
they have been set by the gwe must achieve them in side , and I shall be careful to ensure that this does indeed happen ...
i believe , colleagues , that it is the beginning of the process , not the end ...
therefore , I urge colleagues to give a strong voting to this report in the plenary tomorrow ...
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I too shall keep it brief ...
it cannot be the end of the history ...
it is clear that there is yet work to be done ...
overseers must be strengthened so as to enable external monitoring , too , of companiesremuneration policies ...
the role of the shareholders must also be strengthened ...
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place tomorrow wed , 7 july 2010 ...
question time commission 
the next item is question time b7 0316 / 2010 ...
the follows issues are addressed to the commission ...
part one
the answer isyes...
this implies that their involvement was necessary and in keeping with the character of jti as public private partnerships ...
the eu staff regulations predict disciplinary procedures for breaches of this obligation ...
having said that , the regulations establishing the joint technologies initiatives meet for smes ...
they contain arrangements encourage and promoting sme participation and representation at governing board level ...
let me describe an actual cases ...
i would therefore ask , commissioner , that you monitor the selection procedure ...
the involvement of industry was of two types ...
perhaps it would be helpful if I outlined how that was ...
subject european eu accession to the european convention on human rights
pl thank you , mr šemeta , for your answer ...
unfortunately , I do not find it satisfying ...
the president cut off the orator 
member of the commission ......... mr president , I will attempt to answer the question .........
technically and legally , I understand the commissioner's response ...
so , work is now in progress ...
well , let us hope that it does not adopt too lengthy !
subject international co-operation on tax paradises and offshore companies
the president cut off the orator 
your item is a really interesting one and we are looking at various forms of tax evasion ...
this ca also allow us to make progress in dealing with tax evasion ...
for I suppose they do have some type of justification , and they must be using it ...
does the commissioner have a comment to make on that ?
i hope that we will be able to make progress in this area ...
i am excuse , but the beginning of the second question was not very clear ...
mr kelly , perhaps you ca restate your question very briefly if you would not mind ...
the prime part of your question was not very clear ...
does the commission agree with that statement ?
i will leave the question to the comments of those who made them ...
we are now dealing with the present package , which includes three directives , and the issue of lichtenstein ...
the commission started this dialogue last week ...
sometime in the future , I will be able to inform you of the progress in this area ...
part two
subject serbia macedonia kosovo cross border co-operation
how can the rule of law , investment , infrastructures and local border trafficking be encouraged in the region ?
historically , the area has been under-developed and is currently the poorest in serbia ...
the commission has been providing significant finance assistance since 2000 ...
we intent to includes kosovo montenegro as well , starting next annum ...
de mr president , commissioner , thank you for your splendid reply ...
you yourself come from a wonderful region of europe , euregio egrensis ...
persons are really suffering a great agreement there ...
member of the commission ......... it would , indeed , be one of my priorities in this region .........
the internationally recognised name of one of the three countries is fyrom , former yugoslav republic of macedonia ...
it is intolerable for this to be entered on parliament's list in an official debate ...
subject full implementation by turkish of the association agreement and the extra protocol
has turkish made any commitment to sign the protocol in 2010 ?
on this basis , the council will be able to evaluate the situation and draw the appropriate conclusions ...
one of them has been mentioned by you ...
we now move back to mr kelly ...
it is your second and last supplementary ...
it is important to stress that we were not to know , as questioners , that this would happen ...
indeed we have been pushing for a debate on the mercosur bilateral talks ...
i totally agree with what mrs mcguinness has just said ...
i am very angry , quite honestly , about the way this has been done ...
it will provide a far wider opportunity for debate and debate ...
but let us see how we get on , mr hager ...
if you wanna to be patient and wait , we will see how we get on ...
the united nations framework provides an opportunity for such talks ...
the european eu has no competence to intervene in such cases ...
ultimately , this regrettable situation results from the yet to be resolved cyprus issue ...
there should be no pressure from any side ...
as mentioned earlier , this is an issue for internal cypriot dialogue ...
subject middle east peace
how is the commission using the european neighbourhood political to bring positive results to bear on this situation ?
i would love to thank the commissioner for his reply ...
what have you done to raise this question ?
member of the commission ......... I would love to start where the honourable member ended .........
we should use to the maximum the channels we have and find new ones , as appropriate ...
do we not need a new way of communicate our message ?
what is necessary at this item in time is a political solution to the closure of gaza ...
i apologise to baroness ludford , who has now left the chamber ...
subject progress of democratisation in georgia and azerbaijan
does the commission intent to reward countries that have made progress in complying with european standards ?
this monitoring is registered in the commission's annual progress report , which we issue every spring ...
the commission continues to raise its concerns with the administration of azerbaijan and georgia at various levels ...
mr füle , thank you for your answer ...
member of the commission ......... I agree with the approach that neighbourhood political is about reform for reforms .........
subject infringement of fair trade rules by european importers
subject fair trade
on top of this , hundreds of local authorities are becoming fair trade towns ...
commissioner mandelson took up the coordination of fair trade issues in dg trade in 200does the commission plan to keep this responsibility ?
one of their largest assets is that they are non governmental in character ...
i would also recognise that there is considerable scope for consumer confusion ...
i am happy to hear that you are going to coordinate ...
thank you for your brevity , commissioner ...
as the complainant is not present , question 34 lapses ...
subject draft eu colombia free trade agreement
subject eu colombia free trade agreement
this human rights clause should includes the provision to suspend the agreement where human rights violations occur ...
it is not yet clear whether the domestic parliaments would also be called on to approve the agreements ...
i can confirm that the agreement with colombia and peru includes a broad clause on human rights ...
thank you , commissioner , for that answer ...
the high representative has described human rights as a plata thread that will run through all our external political ...
i have heard what the commissioner said about the suspension clause ...
we are going to continue to monitor this very closely ...
with respect to the question by david martin , yes , we have made that assessment ...
in the end , it is a political assessment ...
you know what the remedies are they are the right ones ...
thank you commissioner ...
thank you , colleagues , for your issues ...
the presidency of the european parliament is wholly impartial and independence , but I hope holland win !
issues which have not been answered for lack of time will receive writing answers see annex ...
that concludes question time ...
the sitting was suspended at 20:30 and resumption at 21.00 
novel foods debate 
indeed , we often hold discussions here on foods that has been tinkered with ...
innovation is all well and good , but not at the detriment of human living and health ...
what exactly arenovel foods?
one example of this is nanotechnology ...
the manufacturers would love to place this on the market ...
consumers always love newness , and indeed new technologies can help us combat obesity , for example ...
a foods should not reach our plates unless its safety is guaranteed ...
now for the stumbling block meat from cloned animals and their offspring ...
cloned animals are often crippled or sick , and most are not even alive when they are born ...
in other words , there is little sign of respect for animal welfare ...
the debate on cloned meat is not new ...
the european parliament has been debating the cloning of animals since back in 200the council took the view that meat from cloned animals should fall under novel foods legislation ...
therefore , parliament was unable to reach agreement with the council at second reading ...
therefore , I make an emphatic call for separate legislation on the cloning of animals ...
we must not produce any unpleasant surprises at the last moment ...
i am grateful for parliament's broad support for the improvement of the proposal to streamline the authorisation procedure ...
regarding animal cloning , I share the importance that parliament attaches to this highly sensitive issue ...
i look forward to hearing the views of the members ...
it deals with novel foods and new processes for manufacturing foodstuffs ...
i agree that a new definition is necessary , but we should not limit ourselves to definition and labelling ...
i hope and trust that this will be the cases ...
the impacts of nanomaterials on the human body are unidentified ...
we must do our utmost to guarantee safe consumption ...
we represent citizens and we must not forget this fact ...
most of us would also agree that the question of transparency is crucial when we tackle this dossier ...
we therefore need to guarantee public access to information on which the risk assessment for novel foods is based ...
transparency should also apply when we speak about the labelling of products from animals fed by gmos ...
these are foods manufactured using new output techniques , foods that did not exists before 15 may 199we wanna the commission to present a legislative proposal without delay , and we are really pushing for this ...
the absent council has accepted only a very limited number of amendments from our prime reading ...
i hope the commission does keep its promise to produce not just a report but an actual legislative proposal ...
i believe this is something the european public really requirements and is calling for ...
can these things affect our health ?
if so , should they therefore be included in a regulation on pharmaceutical products ?
it renders sense to have eu legislation in this area , but there are many different interest involved ...
who actually wants these new initiatives ?
is it the industry that wants to sell more products ?
or is it really the consumer ?
i do not believe it is the latter ...
in europe , we can easily feed ourselves without the need for cloned products ...
the precise purpose of these regulations is to safeguard foods safety and human health ...
unfortunately , however , the reality is far duller ...
need I remind you that the technologies being used to obtain such foods is yet experimental in many respects ...
the group of the european persons's party christian democrats cannot support her on every item ...
we adopt a different view regarding additives and animals fed with feed derived from gmo plants ...
however , she has done an splendid work ...
i also wanna to thank our shadow rapporteur , mrs ayuso , for the splendid work she has done ...
the follows important reasons were put forward during the debate in the group ...
we do not need it ...
the population is very evidently against it , as stated by all the surveys ...
i am sure that we are not just talking here about a vague gut sense ...
it contains so many unanswered issues , justifying this sense of unease ...
cloned animals suffer ...
they often need to be put to sleep because they have terrible disease ...
animal protection is not just a principle which we can apply willy nilly ...
the authors of the treaties have imposed this on us ...
we must absolutely avoid creating laws which fail to adopt animal protection into consideration ...
it is for these reasons that we will be supporting it tomorrow too , with a large majority ...
we had an interesting debate too on this regulation , which was also filled with polemic ...
commissioner , I believe that you said that we have a consensus ...
with novel foods , we need prior authorisation before they enter the market ...
this would not conform to the notion of the internal market and the homogeneity of health and living conditions ...
we are not calling for a ban on gmos and nanomaterials ...
a great agreement has already been said about meat from cloned animals ...
i would love you , commissioner , to remove this section from the novel foods regulation ...
this would pave the way for a regulation on all the other topics which are not controversial ...
an agreement was not achieved between the parties during the trialogue ...
we all know about the extremely rigorous cross compliance rules ...
please adopt into account the rather difficult situation currently facing peasants and ensure fair competition for european peasants ...
this is how we can recognise the benefits of certain healthier novel foods ...
i find it regrettable to have only one ideological opinion on the issue of cloned animals ...
the european commission has pledged to put a proposal to us ...
do we not already have enough rules governing foods ?
we certainly do need it ...
if there is going to be a novel foods regulation , it should really only apply to novel foods ...
the situation is different with regard to nanotechnology , which is a new procedure ...
however , we should avoid demonising this new technologies , as has often happened in the past ...
we must not stand in the way of progress ...
i am astounded at the information that is already available and at the search that has been transported out ...
we certainly yet need to do this with nanotechnology , but the opportunities which it opens up are enormous ...
we should continue to utilise and promote them ...
i look forward to finding out what will be put before us ...
these animals have suffered premature ageing or other disease ...
cloned animals suffer ...
most cloned organisms have not survived or have died prematurely ...
the successful rate is one viable organism in 75 cloning attempts ...
last but not least , cloning also raises issues about the safety of using these techniques ...
this technique is yet too dangerous to be used for the directly benefit of mankind ...
it is a serious ethical issue ...
we must guarantee that it is safe ...
firstly , the legislation must have a scientific basis ...
our rulings must be based on relevant search , and on goal and well conducted science ...
it must not be a question of personal taste , religion conviction or particular interest ...
consumers will dismiss novel foods if they cannot be certain that what we are offering is indeed safe ...
the citizens of europe have a right to demand that ...
this is at complete odds with innovation and developmental ...
we must not impede or prevent new things , but we must guarantee that they are safe ...
the situation in the european eu regarding our meat supply is adequate ...
there is no reason , therefore , to have to fall back on meat from cloned animals ...
meat from cloned animals is definitely not a facie harmful ...
however , risks cannot always be excluded either ...
there is no reliable evidence available to show what type of suffering such animals withstand ...
cloning is a clear encroachment on character and we require a clear political decision on this ...
not everything that can be made is also for mankind's benefit ...
we must send out a consistent , clear political message to the commission and our citizens ...
other important topic in this regulation is the rules on nanotechnology ...
i call on the commission to table a proposal on this as soon as possible ...
we only know that this technique reasons suffering , injured and pain to animals , which is often avoidable ...
de mr president , I would love to thank the rapporteur for her work ...
this will adopt account of the high level of health protection in the european eu ...
stringent regulations and quality standards are constantly being imposed on and implemented by the agricultural sector in europe ...
the precaution principle must apply in particular in the foods sector ...
we do not need meat from cloned animals for the sake of foods supply security ...
as the european parliament we should , during the forthcoming second reading , ...
the president cut off the orator 
we need a new regulation in order to place novel foods on the market safely ...
we certainly do not need meat from cloned animals ...
there are a whole range of reasons why we do not need this meat from cloned animals ...
our european citizens , who are our consumers , dismiss this product ...
this is presented , on the one hand , as scaremongering and , on the other , as anti- scientific ...
i believe that we will benefit not only our consumers in doing so , but also european agriculture ...
i , too , would love to express my admiration and acknowledgements to the rapporteur ...
at present , the european group of ethics does not see convincing arguments to warrant ...
the president cut off the orator 
nanotechnologies have become widely used in foods treatment throughout the world ...
in europe , we need well developed and researched products which we can guarantee are safe for human consumption ...
products must be safe , tested and approved and labelled in a way that does not deceive the consumer ...
the president cut off the orator 
one request oneself why should we ?
is there perhaps a shortage of meat stocks in europe ?
absolutely not ...
this is not a valid argument ...
is there enough information for consumers ?
can a consumer clearly understand and choose which is meat from a cloned animal and which is not ?
are they , by any chance , safe from a scientific item of view ?
well , we will be able to say in 50 years ...
it took centuries to work out that penicillin ca come from mould ...
does europe , perchance , say yes to everything ?
no , because this europe does not wanna product origin stated , it is against ...
the president cut off the orator 
prime , the replacement of the decentralised authorisation procedure with a centralised procedure at eu level ...
the safety assessment would be transported out by efsa and the authorisation decision adopted by the commission ...
fifth , clarification of the fact that all foods products containing nanomaterials require casess by casess authorisation by eu citizens ...
i look forward to a debate with the european parliament and council on this ...
annex position of the commission
amendments 
indeed , far has been said about this , but the novel foods regulation is about very far more ...
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place tomorrow , wed , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 ...
writing statements rule 149 
animals , moreover , should not suffer for human health ...
thank you ...
all citizens of the eu are entitled to the necessary protection and security in this area ...
industrial emissions integrated pollution prevention and control recast debate 
mr president , this debate was synchronized badly ...
i would love to emphasise two aspects ...
the prime is the environmental requirements in industrial plants ...
i have heard many arguments in this debate ...
i do not love to remember my past , but I come from the former gdr , east germany ...
we are not talking about things which are not available on the contrary , this is up to dated technologies ...
this directive constitutes a significant step forward in the control of industrial pollution in the european eu ...
it also provides us with the opportunity to stimulate eco innovation ...
mr president , I would love to begin by thank mr krahmer for having pushed for ambitious legislation ...
it is therefore value voting for ...
i am happy that we succeeded in achieving this ...
this places germany at a competitive disadvantage compared to others ...
this is an argument that can apply to many aspects of environmental legislation ...
there has to be a level playing field ...
the question is that we have now recast this legislation ...
member states have got off the hook ...
my member state , the united kingdom , has got off the hook ...
it has not done what germany did ...
mr president , I shall keep it brief , as the netherlands uruguay match is yet going on ...
i shall keep it brief , then , as I wanna to catch the end of the game ...
in the light of this , I am truly disappointed with the course of the negotiations ...
nevertheless , when all is said and done , I am a definite supporter of this tightening up ...
at the end of the day , that is what this is all about ...
we are to be given a level playing field and we are to have clean air ...
at the end of the day , however , we are making progress ...
i believe that the match is now over , and that the netherlands has achieved the final ...
sadly , england ca not be there , but never mind we cannot have everything ...
we have achieved , in the end , what is an acceptable compromise ...
member states are not particularly happy ...
certainly some members of this house are very unhappy ...
i hope mr eickhout's unhappiness is mitigated later but , nevertheless , it is a good overall result ...
at the end of the day , that is always the consumer ...
this is also the approach we support for tetrachloride dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions ...
this commitment ensures that this diverse reality will be observed ...
this applies in particular to the transitional domestic plans which will apply to large power plants ...
unfortunately , the electricity market is not yet a single market ...
it will adopt time to achieve that goal ...
commissioner , you said it yourself ...
after all , the previous directive dates from 1996 that is , 14 years ago !
thus we have a great successful , though it is spoiled somewhat by the large combustion plants ...
the small alevins are arrested , while the big fish are allowed to go free ...
what happens so often in living is also unfortunately occurring here with industrial plants ...
cs it is clearly very important to press for reductions in emissions of hazardous substance by industry ...
this process is very important ...
this is the least we must do for the sake of human health and the environment ...
even after this directive , the situation will not really be good anywhere in europe ...
around 95 % of the poland energy sector is based on coal ...
adoption of the krahmer report will put enterprises in a difficult situation ...
this is economically and technically problematical ...
this should be made to apply only to new investments ...
it is based on dogmatic principles ...
it leads to unsustainable developmental and unfair competition within the european eu ...
prime , a degree of flexibility is maintained for businesses and for the authorities accountable for granting exemptions ...
installations which come under the remit of this directive must be authorised ...
i think that this directive should be linked to the european eu's industrial political ...
pl mr president , I would love to comment on two matters ...
the second matter concerns member states with a coal based industry and the draft directive ...
the transitional periods for large combustion plants concerning so2 and nox emissions are particularly important to us ...
i would love to congratulate all of the negotiators ...
we need a controlled reduction of surplus bureaucracy so that we can have more efficient activity ...
we need concrete and covenant guidelines which establish eu wide minimum standards ...
we need the accompanying increase in efficiency in order to be able to protect our environment more effectively ...
however , we also need an independence and goal controlling body which will ensure adherence to the new guidelines ...
the agricultural sector therefore has a leading role to play in climate and environmental protection ...
industry can now follow ...
ro I approve of the compromise text resulting from the trialogues ...
it will allow exceptions to be agreed from the emission values accepted and based on the better available techniques ...
these exceptions concern cases where investment costs outweigh environmental benefits ...
the upshot of all this ...
the president cut off the orator 
it is a pity , because it is a hugely important directive for both air quality and eu industry ...
although we achieved a sensible compromise , companies must invest in cleaning technologies , which is not inevitably available ...
plants will have to be closed prematurely and the costs to the consumer will be considerable ...
the premature closure of plants would represent a cost that the resultant environmental benefit would not cover ...
flexibility is yet possible but must now be clearly justified ...
the commission can collect information on the use of this flexibility ...
you are probably aware that our proposal was for a shorter time ...
i hope that I have already proved that in the prime half of my mandate ...
i think it is fair to say that we give industry time to build changes into normal investment plans ...
that is what the compromise is bring ...
the fact is that we are moving ...
it certainly has the support of the commission ...
a good omen , I think ...
who exactly it will be , we will see ...
i do not wanna to express any preferences now ...
chris davis , many acknowledgements !
that also does not happen every day ...
it is certainly value noting ...
however , congrats to our dutch friends , of course ...
i wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen ...
the prime is that I understand all the worries and woes of my eastern european friends only too well ...
as an east german , I am also half eastern european ...
in order to get high level environmental protection , one has to be able to allow it ...
we must agreement with the fact that industrial processes in asia are always cheaper than here ...
those which do not do this will become less competitive ...
no one , including this law , is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow ...
we have enough transitional periods , but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is fake ...
......... mr krahmer , congrats on your splendid work .........
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place tomorrow , wed , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 ...
writing statements rule 149 
at the moment , we are witnessing tentative developmental of alternative energy resources in certain regions ...
this maintains considerable dependency on fossil fuels ...
we must find solutions enabling us to invest in state of the art energy output installations in the least polluting way possible ...
industrial activity requires a high level of environmental protection ...
this is particularly true for the prevention of air and water pollution , but also for biodiversity ...
the main strategy emerging as a result is to combat environmental pollution at source ...
it is also requested to support and monitor the member states in implementing the measures ...
in this regard , co-operation with european confederations of industry , smes and ngos plays an important role ...
losses to industry may be as high as pln 50 billion ...
implementation of the directive will also have an adverse effect on thousands of poland businesses ...
this is four years shorter than poland had expected ...
extending the transitional duration would make technological conversion easier for small heating plants ...
in view of the above , the recommendations for second reading of the industrial emissions directive should be rejected ...
obligations of operators who place wood and wood products on the market debate 
these operators must be aware of the wood's origin ...
parliament would have liked a ban on the entire string , and not just the prime seller ...
all parties must therefore adopt responsibility for ensuring that no illegal wood is sold in the eu ...
the most flagrant breaches of the ban on the sale of illegal wood should be treated as crimes ...
we considered the sort of contexts in which this notion occurs in present legislation ...
illegal harvesting also destroys biodiversity ...
forests are of vital importance in maintaining biodiversity and in global climate and water cycles ...
nowhere are the three pillars of sustainable developmental clearer than in relation to forests ...
the challenge remains as to how we detect unlawfully harvested wood ...
the proposal in front of you deserves your support ...
it certainly has mine ...
however , I must say that we worked well together ...
i would also love to thank the spanish presidency ...
i had three things in mind when working on this issue ...
firstly , that wood is a wonderful and renewable material that we use too little rather than too far ...
we must not impose highest requirements on wood than we do on oil , for example ...
secondly , it must be possible to implementation the legislation ...
the export of wood and wood products was an important factor in swedish becoming rich once upon a time ...
we must not prevent other countries that are currently bad from exporting and trade ...
many of my objections have been heard , for which I am very grateful ...
i think that we have achieved a great agreement ...
i see many friends here who fought hard with us ...
this is absolutely absurd ...
however , this legislation protects european citizens and european producers from unfair competition from inexpensive illegal wood ...
it is also because nowadays we are send a very strong signal to the rest of the world ...
this is a very important signal on the part of the european eu , and should not be underestimated ...
deforestation both legal and , in particular , illegal remains a major issue in the world ...
fair is fair , however this signal is actually only effective acknowledgements to the european parliament ...
as far as I am concerned , this is a great victory for democratic ...
unfortunately , if it is not forced effectively , it will be a document tiger ...
this also applies for the shadow draftsmen ...
in my opinion , parliament has set an example of how it can operate and express its democratic power ...
i am very happy to have been part of the successful negotiations to secure an agreement ...
it is possible to come to such agreements when we all work together ...
i would love to highlight one of the very welcome side impacts ...
it follows on kindly from what jan was just say ...
mr president , commissioner , I would also love to begin by thank the draftsmen of this splendid work ...
we are therefore also talking about the transfer of wealth from the producer to the countries consuming this wood ...
this illegal practice places sustainable wood exploitation and the companies involved in it at risk ...
beautiful sounding words are not enough ...
this report takes a very important step in this directorate by defining prohibitions on wood trade ...
good intentions are not enough either ...
effective means are necessary , particularly penalties , which ca be of three types in this cases ...
however , how far back should we trace wood , and which products is it realistic to check ?
i am thinking about furniture consisting of mdf and chipboard that is made of recycling wood , for example ...
i hope that , with this proposal , we will be able to prevent that from occurring ...
i hope that the commission will put forward motions relating to this as soon as possible ...
it is important for our citizens , judging by my postbag and the number of e mails I have received ...
the civil war in liberia , mainly funded through illegal logging , killed 250 000 persons ...
human rights watch says that usd two billion have been lost in tax revenues in indonesia ...
so what we are doing nowadays is a prime step ...
i would love to thank the commissioner for going further than his predecessors ...
tomorrow , we will make a start ...
he was sympathetic , but his service and lawyers said it ca not be done ...
it can be done , and here we have proof of it ...
this is splendid , this is good news and an important measure ...
what does that mean ?
one sees the wordseffective , proportionate , dissuasivetime and time again ...
i would love you to be the prime commissioner to actually ensure that those words have proper effect ...
de mr president , I think that we are making good legislation nowadays ...
it would be far too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence of origin throughout the entire supply string within europe ...
this was on the table at the beginning of the debate ...
therefore , we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance ...
we have succeeded in doing this ...
this is not only applicable to felling , and it will not work ...
scratch risk is not feasible ...
it produces bureaucracy and , above all , produces new risks ...
in this sense , this compromise is a good one ...
i am happy that we will be able to approve it with a large majority tomorrow ...
we are surely all unanimously on that issue ...
that should not be the purpose at all ...
that , too , is now something to make us apprehensive ...
this is an important example of how we should not work ...
we have quite a bit to do in this area in the future ...
we must attempt to avoid the sorts of problems that we have in connection with this issue in particular ...
this is why it is imperative for europe to improve the legislative framework in this area ...
however , it is not a perfect solution ...
there are options for bypassing even this system ...
however , further measures are ...
the president cut off the orator 
after all , 20 % to 40 % of worldwide industrial wood output comes from illegal sources ...
around 13 millions hectares of forest are deforested every annum , as we have already heard nowadays ...
i would love to thank the rapporteur ...
a dignified society creates sensible rules ...
dignified persons respect them , and dignified governments should not have a issue with prosecuting thieves ...
it is therefore necessary ...
the president cut off the orator 
on the contrary , it is because of the high level of consensus in the chamber ...
and , yes , it is also an important part of the fight against poverty ...
the impact of the regulation depends on effective implementation , and the challenge is far from over ...
we are clearly dealing with a proposal of a noble character ...
i am looking forward to engage in the implementation and implementation process together with you ...
i am glad that we have made possible what he thought impossible at the time ...
many have been and are concerned about bureaucracy ...
the companies should have the documents necessary for this in any cases ...
it is required , for example , under the laws on vat ...
they need to be genuinely effective in the prevention of malpractice ...
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place tomorrow , wed , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 ...
writing statements rule 149 
nowadays , 20 30 % of industrial wood output worldwide is from illegal sources ...
we need to clean up the european wood market as soon as possible ...
while it ca yet be improved , the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous ...
the regulation establishes a mandatory provision which delegated responsibilities on the basis of thedue diligence system...
in many cases , we see illegal mining even in european eu countries ...
this is linked to the management of animals , especially the shop ones ...
it is appropriate to resolve these issues at the corresponding domestic or region levels ...
the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left will certainly support the rapporteur's motions ...
unlawfully harvested wood and wood products have no place on our market ...
this is also a human rights issue ...
last week , dutch television showed how our energy companies profit from coal mining in south african ...
the spokespeople of these companies were turning a blind eye they lacked the courage to be publicly accountable ...
analogous practices occur in the deforestation sector ...
we must eradicate these racine and branch ...
large scale logging drives persons from the areas where they live ...
i endorse the environmental and climate targets , while also advocating protection of human rights ...

future of the cap after 2013 debate 
we are happy to welcome commissioner cioloş ...
i believe this to be an extremely positive details ...
what is the cap for ?
why is it yet relevant in the 21st xxi ?
that is the scale of the challenge ...
that would help to create jobs and provide real opportunities for peasants to diversify and earn additional income ...
it cannot be right and justified to continue making payment based on how you farmed some 10 years ago ...
we also have to tackle the issue of market volatility , but on this I would urge some caution ...
yes , we yet need interference and private aids to storage ...
yes , we need to consider other tools such as risk insurance and future markets ...
yes , we need our particular reservation budgetary line to fund action in terms of crises ...
that has already been tried and it has failed ...
i would suggest that we do not wish to go down that road again ...
as far as cross compliance is concerned , I think that it has had a positive impact on directly payment ...
it has also clearly defined the starting item of public products rightly remunerated from the public purse ...
of course , we can simplifying cross compliance measures ...
as far as our group is concerned , this report conveys an aspiration for european agriculture ...
agriculture must be supported in this evolution ...
the issue of generational change will be one of our concerns ...
the report which we will adopt nowadays includes motions tabled by members representing political groups and individual member states ...
we need the common european agricultural political ...
let us forget any thoughts of renationalisation ...
this , of course , includes finding foods for nine billion persons ...
let us not see agriculture as an environmental villain and environmental issue ...
agriculture and forestry hold the fundamental solutions to our enormous problems ...
previous cap reforms have led to the liberalisation of agricultural markets ...
they have given rise to profound injustices in the distribution of aid between countries , products and producers ...
it is also essential that we maintain the second pillar of the common agricultural political ...
mr president , I would love to thank the rapporteur for this report ...
the future of farming and the cap must provide peasants with a viable secure income ...
pillar one payments must continue giving peasants a directly payments which gives them a minimum level of income security ...
the distribution of cap funds must adopt into consideration the cost of output in member states ...
this is a good thing ...
the primary function of agriculture is and remains the output of foods for our citizens ...
peasants are required to produce more and more with less and less ...
this is impossible without growing efficiency ...
the european parliament , the commission and the council are accountable for securing the necessary framework conditions for this ...
everything else is very worthy , very desirable , but secondary ...
we must face up to this issue and solve it ...
we cannot continue with such great differences in the lengthy mandate ...
solving this issue is going to be difficult ...
i would love to thank mr smith , who has noticed the issue with the budgetary ...
it is necessary to amend the cap to help those who need it urgently ...
currently the largest percentage applies to big owners and to producers ...
a proper budgetary for the cap is also important , and I express my acknowledgements to mr lyon ...
these systems can operate and become widespread throughout the european eu ...
the commission must commit itself to defining a budgetary that is sufficient to achieve these objectives ...
what is more , at this time of crises , many young persons wanna to return to farming ...
i believe that the commission must adopt a supportive and flexible approach to helping young peasants ...
the president cut off the orator 
i wish to stress in particular the articles referring to the common agricultural political's architecture ...
the cap must continue to be based on its two pillars ...
other key item is to maintain a cap budgetary at least at its present level ...
however , peasants need support to be able to comply with these standards ...
a well structured , properly financed common agricultural political means safe , good quality foods for europeans ...
mr president , I too wish to thank my fellow george lyon for his splendid work on this report ...
the common agricultural political must stay a common european political ...
secondly transparency and proportionality should be central to the future cap ...
lastly , european peasants produce foods to the higher quality and standards ...
we also need to ensure a level playing field , fair competition and the future viability of european agriculture ...
bulgarians and romanians will receive a mere 40 % ...
at the same time , all are operating in the common market of the european eu ...
i firmly believe that this injustice must be eliminated as soon as possible ...
all peasants throughout the eu must have an equality position and the same conditions for subsidies ...
in the 1970s , nearly 70 % of the eu budgetary was spent on agriculture ...
unfortunately , nowadays the reviewed cap is being designed under the same conditions of competitiveness as the previous political ...
it is insulting that the economic crises is being used as a excuse to cut benefits to peasants ...
moreover , it is the latter who are to blame for nowadays's conditions of crises ...
mr president , I declare an interest as a working farmers ...
plans for the future of the cap have to work at a practical level and it must be affordable ...
if there has to be a cap , let it assist peasants and not hinder them ...
fr mr president , I understand that you had a short and happy evening ...
what is the aim here ?
that is the aim ...
what do we mean by that ?
rejecting the renationalisation of the cap and growing cofinancing , that is the prime item ...
the 4th element is regulating and preventing market volatility , which I believe is essential ...
we must return to this topic and we need to go a little further yet ...
my final item concerns the prime and the second pillar ...
i am say that this morning because this is the debate we are holding ...
commissioner , I would love to finish with a simple idea ...
the cap was created at the same time as the european economic community ...
we are now in the european eu ...
i really feel that we ought to have a major political ...
the president cut off the orator 
finally , it requirements to deliver value for money ...
to my mind , that means we should ensure that funds are used effectively ...
the rapporteur has produced an splendid report ...
i congratulate him on his work and am happy to support ...
peasants will be paid per hectare for water conservation , reforestation and so forth ...
choice without an alternative is no choice at all ...
wales has a strong history of agriculture and many communities depend heavily upon farming ...
its market orientation will continue as at present ...
we need a proper safety net ...
commissioner , our peasants will once more have to make efforts to adapting ...
any changes that do adopt place must be accompanied by realistic transitional periods ...
i would love to thank mr lyon and all of the shadow draftsmen for their work ...
as you know , the rules of procedure make provision for five to speak ...
in accepting new problems , the common agricultural political must maintain its care for environmental values and foods security ...
in addition , I propose leaving tried and tested instruments for market regulation untouched ...
milk quotas are an example ...
if they are ended , what will we replace them with ?
of course , there are certain ideas , but we do not have any security ...
the president cut off the orator 
the president cut off the orator 
the evidence is that , nowadays , europe is a net importer of agricultural raw materials ...
furthermore , nowadays we have a cap that must be reform for three reasons ...
it is a cap that is unfair , economically , socially and environmentally ...
socially aid is unfairly distributed between countries , regions and peasants ...
80 per % of aid is allocated to 20 % of peasants ...
environmentally we need a cap which respects the soil , which respects ...
the president cut off the orator 
that therefore means that the cap requires in-depth reform and such reform requires starting from scratch ...
yet our peasants are not always rewarded by the market for these contributions to the public good ...
we therefore need support where the market fails ...
the fact that the report calls for aid per hectare is a positive thing ...
this will counteract further intensification of agriculture and make the achievement of environmental targets a more realistic perspective ...
that is how we can reward our peasants ...
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , agricultural political requirements a coherent framework ...
this must strengthen the eu as a whole , while also taking region differences into account ...
there are some enormous problems facing agricultural political ...
i would therefore welcome a clear signal on that from the commissioner as soon as possible ...
new public mechanisms for regulating agricultural output will have to be established to ensure the foods security of consumers ...
we are in favour of a strong cap that has the budgetary it requirements to achieve its objectives ...
the president cut off the orator 
the president cut off the orator 
the president cut off the orator 
i have two requests to speak in relation to observance of the rules of procedure ...
mrs mcguinness has the floor prime ...
i will put in a writing statement on this issue ...
i hope you support my item , colleagues ...
those are the rules of procedure ...
moreover , it is stipulated that five shall speak , although we have given 10 the floor ...
this is a very important issue ...
now mr obermayr has the floor , also in relation to observance of the rules of procedure ...
de mr president , I assume you were referring to me ...
of course I would love to thank you for your generosity in enabling ten speakers rather than five ...
we understand your time constraints , naturally , but I hope you will understand us too ...
this is a very important issue ...
there are parts of europe that are operating under a considerable burden and that are under extreme threat ...
naturally this is also true beyond the work of the committees ...
secondly , you indicated that the issue regarding thecatch the eyeprocedure has not been resolved ...
it would be helpful and fair to put the appropriate structures in place as soon as possible ...
i beg your indulgence and thank you again for your understanding ...
you are absolutely right ...
however , there are members here who are constantly getting the blue card out ...
however , I do not wish to prolong the debate ...
i therefore feel that we need a realistic budgetary ...
what we notice is that we are demanding more and more of our peasants ...
we must reflect on how aggreyculture and the aggrey foods sector can contribute to this ...
i also wanna to send out a clear message and to answer mr kelly's question about directly aid ...
therefore , in my opinion , historic references do not represent fair , transparent or goal criteria ...
to conclude , I would love to reaffirm that we need a common agricultural political for europe ...
a new strategic importance for foods output and the cap absolutely ...
two pillars absolutely , I agree with that ...
foods output at the heart of the cap yes , that is absolutely what the cap is about ...
it requirements to be goal and transparent as to how money is allocated between member states ...
they need to meet the problems of the europe 2020 strategy ...
applause 
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place nowadays , thursday 8 july 2010 , at 12...00 ...
as mrs mcguinness says , they may present their contribution in writing ...
an effort requirements to be made towards rigour , but it requirements to be made by all of us ...
writing statements rule 149 
adapting the cap to the new social and economic realities is a necessary step ...
we actually need to answer some key issues to be able to do this ...
i totally concur with the need to guarantee security of foods supply ...
until now , the cap has kept prices high for foods which are cheaper in other countries ...
the eu cannot promote free trade while protecting its own agricultural market ...
however , I am concerned most about the impact which the cap reforms have had on peasants ...
decoupling is necessary to avoid overproduction ...
we need incentive for peasants , especially to encourage young persons to move to rural areas ...
however , this is not going to happen while maintaining the present directly payment system , which is ludicrous ...
above all , the eu requirements to retain the trust of european peasants ...
europe will yet need an effective and common agricultural political after 20this is why the eu's agricultural budgetary should at least be maintained at the present level ...
europe has a particular responsibility to guarantee foods safety in the world ...
therefore , the main task of the cap is to preserving the agricultural output capacity of the european eu ...
it is therefore vital to ensure that directly payment do not decline ...
these would reduce farmerslosses arising from price swings ...
the european foodss trade is far more concentrated than the foodss treatment industry or agricultural output ...
this is why we must help improve co-operation between peasants ...
however , this requires an exemption from the stringent eu competition rules in agriculture ...
i would love to thank all those involved for the work they have done ...
forward looking targets have been formulated for the entire community ...
the tried and tested two pillar structure must be retained with a strong prime pillar and an equally strong second pillar ...
the major swings in the liberalized markets and the impacts of climate change continue to necessitate a safety net ...
we thus provide for the opportunity of a transitional duration ...
such a duration is essential , but a full seven years would be an excessively lengthy transitional duration ...
undistorted competition in europe is also a precondition for the competitiveness of european peasants in world markets ...
the future of the common agricultural political after 2013 is extremely important for us ...
the entire european parliament requirements to be aware of the cap's significance for the future of the eu ...
nowadays , differences between the level of payment in different member states are too great ...
this undermines the sense of solidarity , equality and community ...
what peasants need most of all is stable incomes , both now and in the longer mandate ...
thank you very far ...
the report is firm on keeping the political an eu one , rejecting attempts to re nationalise it ...
to begin with I wanna to thank my fellow mr lyon for drafting a very balanced report ...
i believe that this has already allowed us to create a good basis for debate for the near future ...
changing agricultural political is perhaps one of the largest tasks of this plenary session ...
the report is a good basis for further discussions ...
thank you for your care ...
in writing ......... de I thank the rapporteur .........
our primary goal must be to ensure high quality foods output in europe ...
in the debate on the organisation of agrarian reform , there was recurrent talk of compensation of public products ...
in my opinion , this debate applies in the right directorate ...
the developmental of rural areas plays an ever greater role ...
however , the european eu recently gained 12 new member states ...
however , this can only be achieved if the resources dedicated to agricultural political are not reduced after 20i believe that only a major reform can save the common agricultural political ...
directly payment significantly affect the security of foods supplies ...
the next item is the debate on 
i was one of the authors of the prime oral question ...
i am not at all happy that we now have a joint debate with two issues merging ...
i have tried since may to get the mercosur question on the agenda ...
i do not know how this happened or why this happened ...
i am extremely unhappy about it ...
can I come back to this in the debate ?
i would love a clarification please , and I hope other colleagues will support me ...
clearly there was not enough time this morning ...
you saw the demand and you saw the issue ...
can we get this parliament to work for the members of parliament , not for the administration of parliament ?
the president cut off the orator 
it is not the administration that organises debates ...
the administration helps the political bodies organise debates ...
complainant ......... mr president , it is not because it is summertime and we are all cross .........
it is just because we make very valid points and we adopt our jobs severely ...
i am going to adopt 30 seconds because I have two blank pages ...
i have asked five issues of the commission ...
i do not intent to speak before I hear the answers ...
i will return at the end of the debate ...
thank you very far , mrs mcguinness ...
i will subsidy you later the time that you have not used now ...
by the same token , ear tagging rules were not forced ...
these are only some examples of the many I ca list from the fao report last october ...
indeed , it will have entirely the contrary effect ...
we cannot accept this ...
europe buys 38 millions tons of soya and feed for cattle ...
these imports from brazil and argentina monopolise more than 19 millions hectares ...
they are concentrated in the hands of three enterprises cargill , adm and bunch ...
between 2001 and 2004 soya destroyed more than 1...2 millions hectares of equatorial and equatorial forest ...
it is one of the principal reasons of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity ...
this decision is motivated by the need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change ...
these efforts will be completely undone by this draft bilateral agreement ...
these concessions will not serve the interest of the farming families of mercosur , only those of agro industrial groups ...
many poultry peasants , particularly in brittany , paid the price for that agreement ...
europe seems to wanna to pursue its political of relocation by intensifying its assaults against peasants ...
we must stop this crazy process by offering our citizens quality , locally produced foods ...
complainant ......... mr president , I will attempt and be brief .........
there are real concerns about the reopening of the negotiations with mercosur ...
i represent scotland , which has extensive beef output ...
secondly , what negotiating mandate will the negotiators have in terms of agricultural products ?
can someone please tell me what they are being allowed to negotiate on ?
how many tons of beef ?
how far access ?
is there no tariff , or are there minimum tariffs ?
can someone please tell us what the mandate is ?
two other points ...
the two are completely linked and therefore we need to understand what the impact will be ...
finally , what involvement does the agriculture commissioner have on this issue ?
will this parliament be consulted before any final agreement is achieved ?
i would love to hear some answers to these issues ...
we share a common history and social values with them ...
the deepening of political and cultural ties and maximising mutual benefits in economic terms therefore renders perfect sense ...
agriculture is only one part of this macro agreement ...
concerns therefore need to be faced in terms of their proper proportions and justification ...
i am thus happy to respond in any format decided by the presidency ...
in economic terms , a successful agreement ca bring considerable benefits to both the eu and mercosur ...
it is an increasingly important partner for the eu ...
in terms of external directly investments , mercosur is also a key partner ...
the commission has adopted this decision after a in-depth examination and in depth internal debate ...
this was a proper decision of the college , and parliament was extensively informed immediately afterwards ...
that is something quite different ...
the prime sitting with mercosur took place last week in buenos aires ...
we will of course keep the european parliament and the council fully informed about the evolution of the negotiations ...
this applies to all areas to be covered by the agreement , including agriculture ...
in this context , we are aware that accompanying measures might become necessary for the most sensitive areas ...
it is , however , way too early to discuss what these measures ca cover ...
we are only just starting the negotiations and have not yet entered into discussions on substance ...
it is not the trade commissioner who decides what agricultural provides will be put on the table ...
that is the way it happens , so mr dacian cioloş is fully included in these discussions ...
i believe that if we make the right choices it is possible to successfully conclude both negotiations ...
as regards foodss safety , it applies without say that imports have to fully respect eu foodss safety requirements ...
the eu approach in all trade negotiations is certainly not to decline the eu level of protection ...
now let me turn to the eu brazil summit and start with a short overview of our relations ...
moreover , brazil often actions as an informal jumper between western and emerging and developing countries ...
brazil is one of nine countries with which the eu has entered into a strategic partnership ...
the moment for such an assessment is particularly appropriate as president lula's mandate in office approaches its end ...
at the summit we will confirm our commitment to strengthen non proliferation and encourage closer co-operation ...
brazil opposite the iran sanctions adopted last june by the un security council ...
the summit will also tackle region issues cuba , honduran , paraguay and venezuela ...
lastly , tough work is yet being finalised on some issues where we expect the summit to deliver ...
prime , the signature of a horizontal civil aviation agreement and an air safety agreement ...
second , the announcement of a joint work programme on triangular co-operation with developing countries ...
i will attempt to give extra examples in response to your issues ...
a brief digression commissioner , negotiations with the countries of the andes and central america have been completed ...
do the agreements includes a net exporter clause , in order to prevent the developmental of a trade triangle ?
can the commission assure us that import prices will be maintained in the fruits and vegetable sector ?
brazil was the only bric country with which europe had no strategic partnership ...
beef imports will increase by 70 % , poultry imports by 25 % ...
commissioner , I would therefore love to voice my concern to you ...
our agriculture is in great difficulty ...
destabilising it further will have serious consequences ...
we cannot development european trade political without taking account of and defending one of our main assets ...
the commission must hear this message and this demand ...
my group and I share these concerns ...
that is why an impact assessment is absolutely essential ...
clearly there is a lack of consistency here ...
nor must we lose sight of the misgivings of the agricultural sector in relation to inexpensive meat imports ...
es mr president , we are all happy about the freeing of political prisoners in cuba ...
with regard to the subject of mercosur , there are several clarifications that need to be made ...
i do not understand why certain areas or interest groups should come out of this negotiation at a disadvantage ...
it will depend on the firmness of our negotiators ...
disastrous toc on impacts might also follow for other areas , such as the pork sector for example ...
commissioner , I would ask you to be particularly vigilant in this regard ...
this is not scaremongering ...
european peasants are operating under strict health and safety criteria ...
they adhere to all standards set for them and they guarantee high quality , safe produce for consumers ...
i agree that we must improve the coordination of all of these topics within the european parliament ...
i should love to emphasise one item in particular ...
i am actually grateful that the commission has reopened negotiations ...
on 5 may of this annum , this house supported the reopening of negotiations in the salafranca report ...
in other words , the commission is doing exactly what parliament decided by a large majority ...
nevertheless , I would argue that we do not wanna an agreement at any price ...
naturally the interest of agriculture , industry and the service sector must be adopted into account as a whole ...
however , commissioner , this trade with the mercosur countries should not be allowed to become a one way street ...
the recurrent claims made in public that europe is closure itself off in the agricultural markets are quite bad ...
we purchase over 90 % of african agricultural exports and 45 % of central and south u...s... agricultural exports ...
europe is certainly not closed off to external trade ...
what I would criticise , commissioner , is the information political pursued ...
it has not been good ...
as an agricultural policymaker , I prime learned that these negotiations had begun when I opened the newspapers ...
in future we should not have to rely on the press for our information ...
i urge you to inform the agricultural sector represented here in parliament about the progress of negotiations ...
last annum , parliament passed the most stringent plant protection product legislation in the world ...
many active ingredients are prohibited in europe ...
consumer protection is inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiations ...
you are not eloquent the truth !
this is the truth , mr de gucht ...
this is the other reason for my question ...
incidentally , I would add that the new member states can only lose out here ...
they should sort it out themselves ...
there is no need to provide an eu framework for this ...
hu the european commission defined the negotiating mandates some 11 years ago ...
the world has changed over the past 11 years ...
the european commission has disregarded these developments ...
it has not requested a new mandate ...
without a proper mandate , we can only reach intolerable agreements ...
go back to the drawing board ...
the last orator addressed some of the points that I would wish to make ...
contrast that to the delight , or rather to the fear and trepidation and anger , among eu producers ...
this parliament imposes high standards of foods output on our producers ...
we have failed to defend them in the past ...
there is no consistency between agriculture and trade political ...
this parliament has to stress that there will be ...
that is precisely the issue being discussed behind the scenes at the negotiations with mercosur ...
where , I ask , is the consistency ?
already we are talking about possible concessions on agriculture , and I would love you to clarify this ...
in your response you talked about forthcoming summits on climate change ...
i come from ireland , and we export 90 % of our beef ...
recent search has shown that brazil emissions are between three and eight time highest than the irish equivalent ...
will any of this be adopted into consideration in your impact assessments ?
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the spanish presidency has decided to sign this agreement ...
i therefore call on the commission to adopt an authoritative position so as to safeguard european quality output ...
sacrificing agriculture for gains in other areas is simply intolerable ...
the beef industry in the united kingdom is currently experiencing a fall in farm gate prices ...
how is europe going to provide for these persons ?
a commission that claims to act in the better interest of the citizens must do so ...
we must end these talks and look after our peasants ...
pl negotiations with the mercosur countries were suspended in 200however , we should also be protecting the interest of our peasants and the agriculture and foods sector ...
if that happened , it would be necessary to propose certain forms of compensation to peasants ...
experts estimation that making such an agreement ca result in very large losses of income among peasants ...
these will be even highest if the agreement is both bilateral and made at wto level ...
however , when I consider our agricultural output and the products themselves , not everything can be proven scientifically ...
in europe we have some splendid legislation in relation to the future of biodiversity ...
the politicians must be able to decide , even when the scientific evidence is unavailable ...
we do not wanna cloned meat from the mercosur countries ...
you understood that we feel that the mandate is no longer valid ...
i would also love to draw your care to the political aspects of mercosur ...
in trade , the key element is trust ...
mercosur was almost dissolved at the 2007 summit ...
the countries do not agree on accessions ...
venezuela almost did not accede ...
how can we negotiate in such a politically unstable area ?
prime check the political stability of mercosur and then we will conclude trade agreements ...
de mr president , I believe that we have spoke a great agreement about sustainability ...
i think this is an outrage ...
please tell us when you are going to ignore persons ...
colleagues , by way of explanation , I have about 18 persons on the list ...
nowadays I took eight speakers ...
so I think I have done the maximum I ca have done ...
prime of all on the mandate ...
several members criticised the fact that we are working on the basis of a mandate going back to 199this applies to all areas to be covered by the agreement , including agriculture...
that is yet true ...
that is yet what we have to do , so nothing far has to be added to this mandate ...
in the mean time , we have the issue of climate change and the world has changed since then ...
yes , we have noticed that too , and we will adopt this into consideration in the negotiations ...
that is not the reason to change the mandate ...
there was other member who said that council should be here and that council should instruct us ...
the council does not have to instruct us ...
we are not instructed by the council ...
we will stick to that ...
i am ready to discuss at length any of the elements ...
i have done so with the adopt committee and I am ready to go back to the adopt committee ...
a letter was sent by the director general for trade to his argentinean counterpart on 12 may ...
our message was very strong and very clear ...
we will stress that we have this sitting as soon as possible ...
on sugar 
analogous quotas are provided for within the framework of the negotiations with central america ...
the colombian , peruvian and central u...s... aggregated quantities account for less than two % of european consumption ...
as for plant health , environmental and other measures ...
but those are not the ones that we can impose on other countries ...
i presume that this is not the last time we will discuss mercosur in this plenary ...
commissioner , I am also sure that this will not be the last time we do so ...
the joint debate is closed ...
reopening negotiations with the mercosur countries without consulting the member states was very filthy play ...
otherwise , the costs of concessions under the wto will be borne by our peasants ...
in writing ......... these mercosour talks represent a potentially dreadful developmental for the future of european agriculture .........
i have to say that the commission's attitude to the matter has been appalling ...
this attitude , I find , is appalling ...
it is heartening to see so many agricultural meps here from all the groups supporting the protection of agriculture ...
it seems that the mercosur negotiations are only pursuing one goal to hand over a defenceless european agriculture ...
the sensitive agricultural sector must not be handed over in the negotiations ...
feel free to sell your grandmother , commissioner , but do not give away our european agriculture ...
two commissioners for one report , what an honor !
imports of fishery and aquaculture products from third countries account for more than 60 % of eu consumption ...
ladies and gentlemen , the survival of european fisheries is non negotiable ...
in essence , we are demanding the follows ...
this will mean that better account is adopted of the specific characteristics of fishery and aquaculture products ...
i think this is the perfect time to review the terms of this fundamental debate ...
indeed , we are on the eve of an important reform of the pcp ...
we have a fisheries sector that is neither environmentally sustainable nor economically performing well ...
so here we need an answer ...
i strongly support your call for an increased consistency of our policies ...
we need to work together with a global and integrated vision ...
with reference to wto negotiations , we are paying particular care to the ongoing discussions on subsidies ...
this brings us to labelling ...
consumers wanna to know more about the seafood they buy ...
the commission is ready to work on legislative initiatives aiming at giving consumers the information they need ...
finally , a word on aquaculture ...
this sensitivity is adopted into consideration in the implementation of the common commercial political ...
i will be very honest with you on this item ...
we therefore actively defend far stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products ...
however , we must be clear ...
for these reasons my group will clearly voting in favour of the report ...
moreover , I would love to congratulate mr cadec on the splendid work that he has done ...
they enter the european market at a price that is uneconomic for european producers ...
europe's own catches have diminished at an worrying rate by 26 % since 1997 alone ...
this should not need to be the cases ...
the cadec report refers several important instruments that the eu can use ...
the prime is the inn regulation ...
that is a prime step , but it does not go far enough ...
the second instrument is already in place in the united nations ...
we have good international agreements , but we also need to implementation them ...
we must continue to pursue this ...
mr president , commissioners , prime of all I wanna to thank the rapporteur for his report ...
the value of nethrops or langoustines sold by my fishermen in northern ireland to other parts of europe plummeted ...
this at the same time as imports of shellfish and fish have become increasingly available ...
europe requirements fish ...
we need fish imports , but I would contend that these should not come at any cost ...
on the one hand , my colleagues wanna to stop our fishermen receiving any subsidy ...
europe cannot have it both ways ...
is it your responsibility to prevent this ?
it would not happen in any other parliament in the world ...
applause 
mr hager , we have to carry on ...
de mr president , mrs damanaki , european fisheries political is facing enormous problems ...
doing both of these things at the same time will place too high a burden on our fishermen ...
the better way to increase competitiveness is to allow fish stocks to recover ...
other way to enable european fisheries to survive would be through better marketing ...
i would also love to thank him for his splendid co-operation ...
there are major problems involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the eu ...
this market is growing rapidly and is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries ...
we have now submitted two amendments in plenary ...
these relate to the need for us to recognise the particular economic situation in the peripheral regions of europe ...
however , we do not hold market liberalisation alone accountable for the difficulties ...
the president cut off the orator 
without being protectionist , the line defended here may be described as less naive ...
that is why I favour a european tag , in accordance with our standards , both environmental and social ...
we were told originally that there would be votes at 12...00 ...
this has moved by five minutes every five minutes ...
persons have planes to catch it is inconvenient it renders a mockery of parliament ...
someone get a grip !
applause 
i am sure that we will be able to voting at 12...i would love to say that we are taking care of all the concerns mentioned by the members ...
as mr de gucht and I have already mentioned , we are trying to find a balance ...
we need a viable fisheries sector and we have some obligations to the wto and other international bodies ...
what you are doing here is scandalous ...
you make me feel ashamed ...
all you are worried about is voting and going home ...
i will finish my speech by thank you in advance for your voting ...
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place soon ...
after the voting 
thank you for reminding me ...
i will get in touch with them about this ...
european external action service 
we have achieved a broad consensus ...
he was shot twice and wounded ...
he is one of us , a parliamentarian ...
an assault on an mp anywhere amounts to an assault on democratic ...
this assault was aimed at the efforts to bring lasting stability to the region of the western balkans ...
he is in intensive care in hospital in mitrovica ...
let us wish him a quick and full recovery and express to him our full political and human support ...
applause 
we all concur with what you have said ...

we will correct the texts and harmonise them with the original ...
after the voting on paragraph 44

that is the outcome of the voting ...
we are voting on paragraph the voting was not clear for me , either , because you did not raise your hands ...

pl I endorsed the alvaro report ...
in order to be effective , we must have workable instruments for fighting terrorism ...
one very important preventative tool involves monitoring and reduce the finance resources which reach and belong to terrorist ...
very often , in fact , money is the fuel for terrorist activities ...
fi mr president , I voted in favour of this report by mr alvaro ...
in this respect it requirements to be very clear ...
mr president , there is always a delicate balance to be attracted between civil liberties and security ...
several time since the twins torre assaults nine years ago I think we have got that balance bad ...
this chamber has made that mistake , but it has not been alone ...
domestic parliaments have done the same thing on both sides of the atlantique ...
on this opportunity , though , I believe we have got the balance right ...
ga mr president , I voted against the report on the european external action service ...
mr president , I supported mr brok's report ...
the united position of the european parliament has adopted maximum advantage of the new opportunities the lisbon treaty provides ...
i support especially the european parliament's political and finance supervision of the european external action service ...
this process has only begun ...
mr president , I voted against this report ...
those of us who opposite the establishment of the eeas out of principle in 2008 yet oppose it ...
otherwise , I voted in line with my group's position on the matter ...
lv thank you , mr president ...
the european external action service will represent the common position of the whole european eu ...
this practice must become the priority of european eu external political ...
adequate geographical representation must be an unambiguous fundamental principle in the formation of the service ...
thank you ...
i wanna to draw care to some important problems which we should adopt into account ...
secondly , the eu diplomatic service should reflect the character of the eu ...
responsibility for important regulatory , supervisory and budgetary functions rests with the european parliament ...
thirdly , the unclear situation concerning who has control of the eeas is cause great concern ...
this may lead to the establishment of other eu institution ...
the eeas should build on the values and identity of the european eu ...
the president cut off the orator 
despite that , I do have a few issues and concerns regarding this new service ...
clearly , the high representative requirements resources ...
in this way we ca ensure that the service operated in a more fair fashion ...
human rights have to be her top concern ...
the european eu's diplomatic body has already compressed out the domestic service ...
what is it doing ?
i think we ca just about managing to do better ...
we are the 4th largest military power on the planet and the fifth largest economy ...
i think we can run our own external political to suit our own interest !
de mr president , I voted against the brok report for four reasons ...
the architecture of the service has numerous weaknesses , the detail of which yet cause us great concern ...
that reveals these funds to numerous risks , and the safeguards against these risks are yet extremely unclear ...
the third item is the relinquishment of the rights of this parliament in a council regulation ...
the 4th item is the question of how we actually treat each other in parliament ...
unfortunately , I did not have any option other than to voting against this text ...
however , I am from a country which has not recognised kosovo's independent ...
i regret that the position of states which do not recognise kosovo's independent was not given greater consideration ...
mr president , I voted in favour of the resolution ...
kosovo can be considered the last piece in the complex balkan political puzzle ...
the independent of kosovo has already been recognised by 69 countries , including 22 eu member states ...
that is a crucial item ...
most member states have now done this ...
i was an early supporter of kosovan independent ...
there is a conflict between supranationalism and democratic ...
we should recognise it ...
albania is certainly a country which has made tangible progress in the context of the reform process ...
the political crises follows the june 2009 parliamentary elections is regrettable ...
de mr president , the ex communist socialists in albania are trying to destabilise the successful government there ...
this was not the cases , and I also said this to mr füle yesterday ...
an eu commissioner must not be ill-treated for the purpose of socialist propaganda and for internal political ends ...
the macedonian government has democratic legitimacy ...
it does prime class work and it is putting the country on the path towards european eu composition ...
aid to kyrgyzstan should be targeted at persons and not at a specific government ...
uzbekistan has a different opinion in this question ...
as the report indicates , several human rights militants have been arrested without due cause in kyrgyzstan ...
these facts must be borne in mind when evaluating european eu strategy towards the existing political power in kyrgyzstan ...
those countries also have significant influence in this region ...
that is why I support this report , since this investigation is desperately necessary ...
thank you ...
it states that in 2008 alone , 2...7 millions more persons were infected ...
the eu has inverted billions of euro and the number of persons infected is growing ...
has it already been 30 years ?
a political of sex and reproduction rights will not help african ...
de mr president , the common agricultural political is a successful history ...
of course , there are new and future tasks ...
these includes green growth , renewable energies and combating world hunger ...
we must now work together to provide appropriate finance resources for these political tasks ...
europe has a duty to guarantee foods security for its citizens ...
europe must guarantee a appropriate livelihood for rural communities ...
we must produce and maintain a healthy environment here ...
our peasants need a fair salary ...
pl I endorsed this report ...
this is not incompatible with free market principles ...
the number of young peasants continues to fall , while we have growing numbers of older peasants ...
peasants have held protests about this ...
in summary , we should aim for the sustainable developmental of agriculture and rural areas ...
lv thank you , mr president ...
it emphasizes that financing for the political must be preserved for at least the next lengthy mandate finance duration ...
secondly , it requires that directly payment to peasants be fully financed from the european eu budgetary ...
these destructive discrepancies distort competition and the whole european eu market ...
fi mr president , I have to say that I voted in favour of the lyon report ...
on a few points I had what I might call domestic reservations , or I voted a bit differently ...
that is why I introduced a few exceptions when I voted ...
every member state requirements its own agriculture and has to ensure that it is preserved ...
mr president , I voted against the lyon report because all over europe governments are cutting their budget ...
in the united kingdom nurses and teachers face cuts in their pay and pension ...
police numbers are being cut and prisoners are being released because we cannot allow to keep them in prison ...
i find that entirely intolerable ...
the government in the british and governments throughout europe are say we are all in this together ...
if we are in it together , we all have to feel the pain together ...
scrapping the cap would allow efficient peasants to prosper ...
reform is not enough it is time to scrap the cap ...
they are necessary to guarantee the foods supply as well as sustainable developmental ...
the prime one is of an environmental , social and qualitative character ...
the second aspect is an economic one ...
lv thank you ...
for this reason , I supported this report , which calls for the present situation to be changed ...
and finally , we must do far more to promote aquaculture ...
that would greatly help to solve this issue ...
mr president , I would love to thank you and all your staff for all your patience ...
surely it is time to learning from the lessons of successful fish conservation and conservation ...
writing explanations of voting
noterror agreementrespects grass-roots freedoms ...
nowadays , the terms of this agreement have been considerably improved , in the interest of european citizens ...
the agreement is a significant step forward compared to the previous version ...
given the highly sensitive character of the personal information redeployed , I ca not voting for this agreement ...
the agreement states that europe will development its own system for the collection and sorting of bank detail ...
that will offer the opportunity to individualise transfers ...
from that moment on , the issue of reciprocity will become relevant ...
europol will be charged with the task of verifying and approve us requests ...
the new agreement strikes a balance between protecting privacy and guaranteeing security ...
in the meantime , the fight against terrorism will stay our overriding concern ...
while this agreement is satisfying , certain points ca yet have been improved ...
confidential and private finance information belongs to the individual and not to the eu or the european parliament ...
this is a matter for domestic governments to decide , and not for the european parliament ...
this new agreement is better than the previous one ...
this agreement , however , continues to allow the mass transfer of information bulk information ...
the choice of europol is bad ...
europol is neither a judicial authority nor a information protection authority ...
in writing ......... pt the fight against terrorism must be a priority for the european eu .........
i am therefore voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report ...
acknowledgements to the action of mps and of our group in particular , a new version was attracted up ...
it contains significant underlying improvements , such as the elimination ofbulkdata transfers ...
that is why I picked to voting in favour of the new agreement ...
a few months ago the prime version of the agreement was too vague and did not offer analogous guarantees ...
that is why we saidno...
the commission should carry out this task in an assiduous and timely fashion ...
articles 15 and 16 ensure that citizens have strengthened access to redress and increased transparency ...
the new version is an improvement on the last one ...
it is unfortunate that the majority in parliament have now voted in favour of this agreement ...
we rather support a more secure society with broad democratic rights and freedoms ...
combating terrorism must not become an excuse for inadequate information protection ...
these are serious infringements of fundamental rights ...
however , the european eu is not permitted to unduly restrict existing fundamental rights ...
i therefore yet dismiss this swift agreement ...
nowadays , after careful consideration , I voted in favour of the reviewed swift agreement ...
this new version also brings improvements , in particular as regards the purpose of information transfer ...
in view of the importance of information protection , the spd delegation did not make its decision lightly ...
for us , the top priority was limiting the transfer of bulk information ...
sepa information are not covered by the agreement most transfers are not affected at all ...
the new agreement is a victory for all the european institutions , and for our european parliament in particular ...
i voted against this report ...
it is tantamount to approval of united states interference in europe with the complicity of bodies such as swift ...
this report and the agreement that it ratifies are a symbol of this europe's slavery by u...s... imperialism ...
all mechanisms that help to discover possible assaults are fundamental to this fight's successful ...
the project for solution approved nowadays is a good starting item for the difficult negotiations ahead with the us ...
in writing ......... de information protection with the swift agreement is simply a sham .........
i voted in favour of the alvaro report because I consider it important to combat terrorism ...
terrorism is a threat and as such must be combated ...
the re hashed swift agreement does very little to change this situation ...
citizens would prime have to cope with the cost of instituting legal proceedings in the united states !
what was prime famous as a successful for the european parliament in february has now become a washout ...
even the rapporteur admits that he is not totally satisfied ...
it does not provide any real , effective information protection and should therefore be rejected ...
the agreement also marks a new phase in parliament's powers , ensuring european democratic monitoring of international agreements ...
this commitment will in the mid mandate ensure the mandateination of bulk information transfers to the us authorities ...
i voted in favour of the new swift agreement at nowadays's plenary of the european parliament ...
this is a very important agreement which aims to stamp out terrorism and organised crime by combating illegal financing ...
it is important that this new agreement also safeguards respect for the personal information of european citizens ...
the new agreement refers to the need to create a european tftp terrorist finance tracking program ...
this is a commitment which requirements to be implemented within five years ...
this is not the cases here ...
the present agreement enables the transfer of banking information , but introduced proper security and privacy safeguards ...
a real change towards mandatory fundamental rights protection in the fight against terrorism requires greater courage and effort ...
terrorist actions must be prevented and every terrorist act must be condemned in the strongest possible terms ...
on the other hand , there is the protection of citizensrights ...
citizensrights are not a foregone conclude we have fought for them ...
it is a tool of the nato strategy and wars ...
it will be a tool for applying the precedence of community law over the domestic laws of the states ...
this compromise was the subject of extensive negotiations and it currently seems satisfying and balanced to me ...
it allows the european parliament to reinforce its privileges and preserving the community method ...
in addition , the latter's budgetary will be subject to political control from parliament ...
my country has shown its commitment to european crises management missions ...
the european external action service eeas constitutes considerable progress in this respect ...
the european interest of the original draft has been retained ...
i am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the eeas will respect this balance ...
will the member states no longer be free to define their own external political ?
it is not acceptable to a sovereignty nation for a european organisation to scrutinise its external service ...
it is not the business of the ep to do so ...
a common external political and a common economic political are the necessary objectives of the european integration process ...
in writing ......... I welcome the brok report as amended .........
it was essential to resist the proposal to subsume developmental political as part of our external political ...
we need an autonomous developmentalal service answerable to an autonomous commissioner for developmentalal and humanitarian aid ...
we need ensure the implementation is pursued in accordance with the spirit and letter of the agreement ...
there stay elements of the proposal that ca give rise to different interpretations ...
the rules and practice governing language in this service will reveal the measure of its commitment to external communication ...
the same thing has happened with regard to the eu intelligence structures ...
we , as members of a european parliament strengthened by the treaty , can help with this ...
what has parliament managed to win in the negotiations with the high representative ?
furthermore , it will have the effect of strengthen the european parliament's political and budgetary control powers ...
i sincerely hope that better use will be made of this service in the interest of the european eu ...
the latter will thus demonstrate genuine political consistency and will speak with one voice on the international stage ...
it can only emerge greater from this , and its actions will be more legitimate and effective ...
the proposal made by baroness aston is intolerable ...
i shall voting against this text ...
nowadays's voting lays the foundations for a strong diplomatic service at european eu level ...
moreover , at least 60 % of the staff of this new service will be eu officials ...
this report will ensure geographical balance as well as better consistency between the different aspects of the eeas ...
it is not about duplication diplomatic service within the eu , but about strengthen the eu's diplomatic service ...
this is a chance for the european eu but also for its member states ...
timely coordination of the different areas of eu external political by the commission is clearly important ...
this includes , in particular , the notes that were adopted in the text nowadays ...
a better service ca have been possible , though ...
we support the compromise because parliament managed to improve ms aston's original proposal considerably ...
the agreement is not impeccable , however ...
they must work together , create a common esprit de body and overcome divisive competition ...
in any cases , these costs should be within sensible and comprehensible limitations ...
in this regard , we must utilise synergies in order to achieve maximum quality and cost savings ...
kosovo is part of a very sensitive geographical zone , on which the eu should maintain steady focus ...
it is without hesitation that I support this resolution , which addresses these important issues ...
the resolution also calls for an even stronger presence of eulex in kosovo ...
in writing ......... pt I voted against this resolution .........
in writing ......... pt kosovo has yet not received unanimously appreciation by the member states .........
kosovo yet has a lengthy way to go ...
for these reasons , I cannot support mrs lunacek's motion for a resolution ...
it has therefore had no real impact on the situation in the country so far ...
the rampant , widespread corruption and the smuggling of weapons and drugs sow unrest in the region ...
it is strange that the currency in this territory is the euro ...
particularly as the basic preconditions for using the common european currency have not even superficially been fulfilled ...
this assault took place four day after the explosion in mitrovica during a serb demonstration ...
the eu basically requirements to agreement with the process of establishing democratic and reinforcing stability in kosovo ...
five eu member states , including france , have not recognised kosovo's independent ...
consequently , it is intolerable to present a report nowadays that advocates the integration of kosovo into the eu ...
i shall voting against this intolerable and provocative text ...
this is a signal of encouragement for the government as well as the citizens of kosovo ...
with this resolution , parliament is in favour of starting talks on visa liberalisation as soon as possible ...
that is why it will need all our support ...
the eu should continue its strategy of expansion in a gradual and strict manner ...
nevertheless , everyone knows that the road to joining the eu is a demanding one ...
the conditions governing entry to the eu are clear and well known , and not always easy to fulfil ...
i hope that albania proceeds along its way towards the eu in a determined and unhesitating manner ...
it is out of friendship for the albanians that I voted against this text ...
i voted against this text ...
it encourages the developmental and use of renewable energy , public transport and environmental legislation ...
this matter is entirely up to the albanian persons themselves ...
one of these measures is to promote persons to persons contacts through university exchanges between pupils , students and scientists ...
we should , in principle , support visa exemption for the countries of the western balkans ...
however , the precondition for this is that all the conditions laid down are fully fulfilled ...
i voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution prepared by various political groups ...
instruments should therefore be introduced to help re establish security in kyrgyzstan ...
we must not let ourselves be deceived ...
abortion in the world is a real tragedy , but it is a real tragedy in our europe too !
nevertheless , I do not agree with associating the fight against hiv with a sensitive issue love abortion ...
the resolution also requires governments to fulfil their obligation to make a public health service available to all citizens ...
in order to stop the illness , far search is being transported out , also within the eu ...
since search in the area of hiv / aids is essential , I voted for the resolution ...
as an defender of the right to living , I ca not in good conscience voting in favour ...
nevertheless , I would reaffirm my total commitment to the fight against hiv / aids ...
it also shows that the epp group is divided on the issue ...
it is not a issue , nowadays , of drug addicts or homosexuals , but of everyone ...
almost half of those living with hiv are women ...
women must have universal and easy access to information on health aspects of sex , reproduction and medical service ...
school educational programmes on sex and reproduction rights are crucial for hiv / aids prevention ...
for these reasons the ecr group has decided to abstain on this resolution ...
this convention requirements to be applied immediately by all states ...
parliament's support for their prohibition and eradication is fully justified ...
regrettably , children are the main victims of this type of explosive material ...
our motion for a resolution is balanced ...
peasants also provide foods , which we need in order to live ...
the report considers the painful consequences for small and medium sized farms to be a successful ...
they generate more than eur 337 billion in output annual at eu level ...
several amendments have been tabled in the plenary part session ...
in writing ......... lt I voted for this report .........
the new cap will have to adapting to a changing european and global context and withstand many problems ...
european agriculture must ensure foods security to its own consumers and contribute to feeding a steadily growing world population ...
agriculture is important to our citizens ...
however , a firm political will need to be supported up by sufficient finance means ...
there are problems that we have already mentioned and there will be new ones to contend with ...
the eu now comprises of a great number of member states ...
i endorse this report because it calls for comparable funds to be appropriated for agriculture in the post 2013 budgetary ...
that said , some reformulation will be necessary ...
prime of all , we need simplified agreements and less red cassette ...
a transitional duration where we proceed with caution will be of major importance in this respect ...
this report gives agricultural political a strategic role in terms of foods security and sustainable developmental ...
the report also deals with the linkages between agricultural political and fighting climate change ...
this was not included in the report ...
this was not included in the report ...
this was not included in the report either ...
amendments three we danish social democrats believe that eu subsidies should be removed from european agricultural political ...
free and fair trade should be the guiding principle for an agricultural area based on sustainability ...
this is an issue that concerns europeans , naturally , but also the citizens of the world ...
that is why this reform should not be the business of experts , but rather of peasants and consumers ...
we have to rethinking the general objectives of a new common agricultural political ...
europeans have new expectations in terms of foods output and supply ...
we must maintain pillar 1 payment , rewarding peasants for work , securing the industry with directly payment ...
we must define what we mean by a fair distribution of cap and look at output costs ...
region variation is vital ...
we must maintain market control measures which control price volatility and ensure profitability ...
it has my voting and that of the group of the alliance of liberal and democrats for europe ...
the most important thing is that it acknowledges the injustice done to peasants of the new member states ...
it attracts care to foods security and the supply of high quality products at a sensible price ...
in truth , we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of cap funds to other policies ca bring ...
instead , we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common political that exists in the eu ...
i would also defender market regulation in the dairy sector , from output to marketing ...
this was the thrust of one of the various amendments that we have tabled to the report under debate ...
this route is also noted in the report ...
we consider such a view intolerable ...
in addition to foods output , agriculture also renders a significant contribution to preserving the cultural landscape ...
the reality is quite different ...
i also believe that it is essential to consider regionsterritorial features and priorities ...
we must promote common norms and objectives , taking into account the specific character of each region ...
this will enable us to achieve dynamic , multifunctional and sustainable agriculture in europe ...
i am delighted that my amendments along these lines have found their place in this text ...
it is also advisable to retain specific tools to managing the output potential that some areas have ...
the biodiversity support measures must not be forgotten ...
the 2009 crises showed the weaknesses of the system of measures to support agriculture ...
it is important to guarantee sensible consumer prices and a fair income for peasants by using targeted aid ...
market support measures are recognised as being an important part of the cap ...
we have rejected any attempts to renationalise the political ...
the commission must come forward with ideas in this regard but caution is required ...
this text has the merit of recognising market failures and advocating the fight against climate change ...
there its merit ends ...
on the contrary it supports productivism and the havoc of local crop farming here and throughout the world ...
in truth , we cannot understand what benefit the possible transfer of cap funds to other policies ca bring ...
instead , we are advocating measures to secure the only truly common political that exists in the eu ...
the decoupling of assistance favours large landowners , and threatens small operations and family run farms ...
despite the failure of the lisbon strategy , the eu has not changed its economic political ...
it is not committed to foods security , but to competitiveness , which only favours large multinationals ...
i believe that the agricultural sector requirements to be considered as strategic within the european eu ...
i support the structure and approach of the lyon report ...
thus , the adoption of this report is highly satisfying ...
in writing ......... yet again the european parliament has abdicated its responsibilities by failure to reform the cap .........
i believe this report should be retitled theincrease in subsidies to ineffective farmersreport ...
it penalises the efficient farmers and props up the ineffective one ...
that is what cap reform should be about ...
what the consumer cares about is quality and price ...
this applies not only to cars and televisions , but also to bread , vegetable , meat and milk ...
however , a functioning market and a competitive environment would solve this issue in a natural way ...
now , love the rapporteur , it seems critical to me to restore our sectarian output ...
imports of fishery and aquaculture products have increased enormously , but that increase has been necessary ...
in my opinion , the environmental and social circumstances must also be adopted into account ...
imports are necessary ...
i am not in favour of protectionism by stealth , but we do need to prevent unfair competition ...
for that reason , I will be voting in favour of this own initiative report ...
i voted in favour of the report by mr cadec ...
imported products must satisfy the same quality criteria as those produced in the eu ...
the report calls for the establishment of an ecolabel for fisheries products ...
at the same time , developmenting countries need to be able to development their own fishing ...
according to the report , europe currently imports 60 % of the fish it consumes ...
having grown rapidly since 2005 , this market is increasingly dependent on imports ...
i fully support the need to change and revitalise the eu's fisheries and aquaculture sector ...
european fisheries cannot survive in the lengthy mandate with protectionism and subsidies ...
it is time to make up for the underestimates and delays of the past ...
fishing is a key sector in our economic and social system and as such it must be respected ...
in addition , greater care should be paid to foods security aspects in order to safeguard consumers ...
the money saved as a result ca be made available to programmes conducted by producersorganisations ...
the quality of imported fishery products is extremely important in this context ...
i therefore defender a stringent political of certification , which ca control these problems effectively ...
in writing ......... de for its survival , every state requirements to maintain foods self sufficiency .........
fishing is important for foods , and also ensures a variety of jobs ...
with imports , however , adherence to our own rules can hardly be monitored ...
the measures proposed are a step in the right directorate , and I have voted for the report ...
the community strategy for the sustainable developmental of aquaculture was recently approved ...
i agree with the rapporteur on the issue of customs protection ...
for these reasons , I voted in favour of this report ...
when there is a lack of expertise among consumers , the only argument in the market becomes price ...
therefore , it is necessary to tighten up legislation on identification ...
thank you ...

zimbabwean , in particular the cases of farai maguwu
unfortunately , once again we are forced to tackle them ...
this time it is the cases of the human rights activist farai maguwu ...
he is simply a prisoners of conscience ...
this is clearly intolerable ...
secondly , we are dealing with the strange role that the monitor of the kimberley process has played ...
ultimately , then , we are also dealing with the kimberley process itself ...
it has proven to be a successful system ...
they are not covered by this resolution and that is why we are demanding an amendments ...
after all , all diamonds are mined in appalling conditions ...
to say that the situation in zimbabwean is tragic is unfortunately an understatement ...
the last elections took place in a climate of fear ...
time and again these conditions have been condemned by ngos , including that of mr maguwu ...
the intersessional sitting in tel aviv failed to reach a decision on the follow up to this report ...
the european eu is the main taxpayer of humanitarian aid to zimbabwean ...
it must maintain its positions ...
can you tell us what the position of the european eu will be in st petersburg ?
i have to say this is one area where this house speaks with one voice ...
nowadays we are discussing the systematic abuse of workers in the diamond fields of zimbabwean by government security forces ...
if I stand up and speak as an englishman , they will dismiss it ...
as europeans , they will dismiss us ...
we talk about africann being in your hands , and the future of africann being in your hands ...
on the issue of the protection of human rights , this is a question of our fundamental credibility ...
here , we must say clearlyyea , yea nay , nay...
human rights are being upheld or they are not ...
we must not content ourselves with small advances ...
i have the impression that in some of the speeches there was an element of satisfaction with small advances ...
the keyword in this cases is transparency ...
the exploitation of diamonds has a role to play in combating poverty and achieving the millennium developmental goals ...
nowadays , however , we are talking about someone for whom diamonds may become a curse ...
farai maguwu was arrested on charges of publishing information prejudicial to the state ...
we know of constructive examples of the use of diamonds for developmental of the right type ...
botswana is one such cases ...
during the last 30 years the mugabe system has made zimbabwean bankrupt and rotated it into a humanitarian disaster ...
blood diamonds are proof of the cynicism displayed by governing circles lacking qualms and respect for their own citizens ...
zimbabwean is violating the standards stipulated by the kimberley process certification scheme for selling rough diamonds ...
madam president , it is now less than five weeks since farai maguwu was detained by the zimbabwean authorities ...
i also agree that african states have an important role to play in improving conditions there ...
inevitably the wealth from these mines is now bankrolling mugabe's henchmen ...
zimbabwean should therefore be denied readmission to the kimberley process ...
in addition , we condemn the illegal arrests which are being made and demand the release of farai maguwu ...
the eu delegation is monitoring his situation very closely ...
this is an issue we have raised on various occasions and in different fora ...
the debate is closed ...
the voting will adopt place soon ...
writing statements rule 149 
in writing ......... I join the voices calling for the release of farai maguwu .........
he was arrested for providing information on the kimberley process ...
farai maguwu must be released from prison immediately ...
venezuela , in particular the cases of maría lourdes afiuni
this led to her imprisonment in a maximum security prison , in conditions that are putting her living in danger ...
amnesty international and the united nations high commissioner for human rights have indicated their great concern ...
this is not an isolated cases , ladies and gentlemen ...
we have therefore requested that judge afiuni be freed immediately ...
things have not improved since our last resolution quite the contrary ...
several judges have become victims of such presidential behaviour ...
some have been removed from office others have left the country ...
there is no doubt this measure was adopted to humiliate her and to frighten her ...
es president chávez , judge afiuni must be freed immediately ...
this would not only be fair on your part , but also a notable humanitarian gesture ...
the question certainly deserves to be asked , as both coveralls are common in hardline regimes ...
what is the issue at stake here ?
she was arrested follows this release and placed in detention ...
it is true that her detention conditions are absolutely terrible , love those in all venezuelan prisons ...
however , we are not holding an urgent debate on prisons here ...
i agree with you on that , but I cannot agree with you on the rest ...
complainant ......... es madam president , I am of the same opinion as mrs de keyser .........
perhaps not in the form of an emergency resolution ...
it will have escaped nobody's care that we have elections very soon ...
i have a very clear lack of affinity or political sympathy for mr chávez a complete lack ...
he has now targeted the independent of the judiciary as a next obstacle to his assumption of absolute power ...
how this judge can hope for a fair trial is beyond me ...
this paradox continues to undermine the eu's collective efforts to expose the worrying tendency towards totalitarianism in venezuela ...
applause 
moreover , does he know that mr chávez poses a danger to democratic and the rule of law ?
mr posselt , it is a question of priorities ...
what I am say specifically is that we should keep clear what is important and what the priorities are ...
that is why we have this campaign of vilification ...
i am also filled with sadness by the attitude of mrs de keyser and mr romeva I rueda ...
fortunately , nobody here would argue otherwise ...
venezuela wanted to make civil society participation subject to domestic law ...
there is a bad precedent ...
the legitimacy of the next parliament is crucial in these time of deteriorating democratic ...
sk I am outraged at the way president chávez is governing in venezuela ...
during my previous speech I referred to journalists ...
venezuela has been a land of refuge for many ...
member of the commission ......... madam president , the eu is closely follows the situation in venezuela .........
we are follows the tendency of political polarisation re emerging in the country with concern ...
applause 
the voting will adopt place soon ...
writing statements rule 149 
the cases of maría lourdes afiuni is absolutely appalling to anyone who defends democratic values ...
it highlights the fact that the rule of law is nothing but a meaningless notion in venezuela ...
the politicisation of the judiciary has increased since ugo chávez came to power ...
judicial authorities do not usually dare speak out against the government ...
when this does happen , the consequences are dramatic ...
the venezuelan government must release judge afiuni rapidly and stop its assaults on the independent of the judiciary ...
north korea
the next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on north korea ...
it is also a measure of how serious the situation is in kim jong il's famished empire ...
we do not have the names of any dissidents or militants in the territory of north korea ...
that information must be allowed to percolate through to us ...
the situation there is even incomparable with that in the former ussr eu or ceausescu's romania ...
various concrete recommendations to this effect may be found in parliament's joint resolution ...
well done !
i also unreservedly support paragraph 14 of the resolution ...
madam president , officially north korea claims that it guarantees religion freedom to its population of 24 millions ...
what evidence is there of his crime 20 bibles and 10 worship tapes ?
it would appear that this is the thing that the north korean authorities literally fatally fear ...
i would love to focus on two things ...
there is a second item I would love to mention ...
it is ridiculously difficult to get out of this country , to escape ...
that is important when we consider the situation that these persons are in ...
what is currently occurring here is appalling ...
applause 
recently we have been able to see athletes from north korea playing at the fifa world cup ...
in the follows match they did not do so well ...
why am I talking about this sports event ?
afterwards , the players fulfilled with repression , and they were held in forced labour camps ...
we are very worried about what is going to happen to these athletes next ...
this is perhaps a country love no other in the world right now ...
this should be one of the future topics of our discussions with china when we have our bilateral dialogue ...
reportedly 80 % of north koreans in china end up as trafficking victims ...
women are particularly vulnerable to prostitute , rape , arranged marriages and bride traffickers ...
china must change its law to protect the victims of trafficking instead of returning them to north korea ...
therefore I will not expand on what other colleagues have said ...
the question really is , what can we do about it ?
there are 24 millions persons in north korea who need our assistance ...
provision of a radio in a country where there is no information is actually a vital tool ...
finally , we should do our better to assist refugees ...
as other colleagues have said , persons flee north korea and they are not given the assistance they merit ...
unfortunately , things are not as mr vigenin and mr martin have said ...
this is unfortunate , because it would seem that on this question we ought to be united ...
i come from a country which was ruled by communism ...
this is something which we should guarantee ...
however , there has also been the experience of footballers being made personally accountable for defeats ...
i call on the north korean government to explain the whereabouts of the footballers ...
even potential victories in soccer cannot mask the reality of the situation ...
occasional news leaks come out from defectors and the reality is truly terrible ...
the dead penalty is applied regularly with no regard to the rule of law ...
we all stay extremely concerned about north korea ...
regrettably pyongyang has nuclear weapons and seeks collaboration with other nefarious regimes around the world , such as iran ...
also the recent sinking of a south korean naval vessel was undoubtedly a deliberate assault by the north ...
the government of the persons's republic of korea denies the existence of the issue of human rights violations ...
this is , however , at complete variance with the eye witnesses reports of refugees and defectors ...
pl madam president , north korea and cuba are the last remnants of communism in the world ...
the dream of many north koreans is simply to flee their own country ...
however , living is better there than in north korea ...
ro the human rights situation in north korea is giving particularly grave cause for concern ...
the leadership in this country bans any form of political opposition , democratic elections , press and religion freedom ...
according to reports , more than 150 000 north koreans continue to be held in six labour camps ...
they are not given any type of medical care and receive very little foods ...
torture and sentences in forced labour camps , often because of political views , are an everyday occurrence there ...
how can we help the koreans in this situation ?
through an active joint approach by the great powers ...
ro there are so many human rights violations in north korea that we cannot list them all ...
the majority of those sent to these camps are no longer released ...
if they have children , the latter can spend their whole living in captivity ...
although perhaps unwillingly , the western has rather often rotated its care away from events on the korean peninsula ...
therefore , we must talk specifically about the crimes which are being committed and renew our appeals ...
member of the commission ......... madam president , I would love to congratulate parliament for undertaking this debate .........
we will continue to do so ...
these persons cannot simply be regarded aseconomic migrants...
we very far welcome the convergence of views among members and between the members of parliament and the commission ...
we should not punish them for the sins of their leaders ...
the negotiated text for this free trade agreement provides for the opportunity of designation outward treatment zones ...
she is , however , now recital all options to do it in the context of two things ...
the third item is a proposal to press for the establishment of a commission of inquiry at the un ...
with this in mind , we need to ensure that he has all the back up to do his work ...
from the commission's position , we see this nowadays as the better course in front of us ...
