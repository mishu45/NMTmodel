in my opinion , eu poss handle migration phenomenon truly bring shame on europe .
member state be reduce they development aid and prevent develop country from achieve millennium development goal .
this have my unconditional support .
for this reason , i have vote in favor this impeccable report by mr claey .
this agency be conceive as important instrument common european strategy towards illegal immigration .
we green do not see many problem there , so we vote in favor .
therefore , i be vote for ep position .
furthermore , article 3 state thatmember shall vote on individual and personal basis .
agreement concern way in which mandate be to be exercise shall be null and void .
this situation be reprehensible , unacceptable and scandalous .
evsk i , entail , as it be , two problem .
evsk i . decide to endorse request for defense immunity and privilege valdemar toma ?
kara report be in line with european response to greek crisis .
european union have learn lesson from greece poss experience .
notion turn eurostat into audit institution be reject five year ago .
however , what be relevant be that proposal now have every chance be implement .
accurate , credible statistical datum be prerequisite for economic and monetary union to operate properly .
such value should be establish as early as possible in relation to notification period .
this will allow they to assess state country poss public finances .
this report be another step towards monitor internal workings country , this time through statistics .
this report advocate absolute respect for stability and growth pact .
it urge introduction unannounced control on budget member state .
it build up suspicion into political doctrine by demand that member state who falsify they statistics face sanction .
european project can not allow itself to become confused with this authoritarianism which contradict sovereignty people .
it go without say that this be scandal .
this kind thing must never happen again .
only in this way will stability pact be worth paper it be write on .
i therefore vote in favor this report .
if previous datum be know , there be no need for additional argument .
harmonisation statistical datum collection
standardise statistical and budgetary information supply by member state
i therefore vote in favor .
i support this report .
i welcome report on european union strategy for baltic sea region .
baltic sea strategy be first attempt to make use macro region .
this macro region will not be compete with member state it will complement they .
this new form governance will undeniably bring add value to local , national and european policy .
purpose strategy be to solve common problem and to concentrate action on achieve share objective .
there be two major area interest for this region environment and scientific development .
these be four particularly important step for lithuanium .
only merit this report be that it demand elimination pollution in baltic sea .
this elimination be necessary for preservation we ecosystem .
it must be carry out as quickly as possible .
as for its state desire to establish highly competitive european macro region , this be completely unacceptable .
throughout these region , they be aim once again to dismantle welfare state .
remediation baltic sea region can not be carry out in way advocate by liberalism .
this be important part external relation eu and its member state .
baltic nuclear triangle be create be not just concern for lithuanium but whole europe .
in eu , it be important to have macro regional vision baltic sea region .
eu can not forbid construction nuclear power plant right next to union poss border .
however , together we can negotiate with belarusian government on location construction .
this report advocate importance develop strategy for macro region in european union .
these be see as set territory group around common objective and challenge .
eu strategy hold enormous potential for we and we neighbor within several policy area .
optimal result can only be achieve with pool resource towards commonly define goal .
we also need to address lack appropriate infrastructure and accessibility between various transport network .
implementation strategy have be slow so far .
we need to kick start process and step up we effort .
i congratulate rapporteur on very well draft report .
document refer to several crucial issue environment , energy and external affair .
russia , belarus and norway should be involve in this cooperation .
interdisciplinary cooperation be need here , include in european parliament committee .
this macro regional strategy for baltic sea be pilot project .
european institution , in particular european commission , should fulfil they role provide coordination and support .
today , all actor in we region be affect by crisis .
i support this report .
properly coordinate eu regional policy may strengn competitiveness and employment in eu poss region .
we sme , which make up 99 % europe poss productive fabric , need freedom from bureaucracy .
european union and its member state be face major financial , economic and social crisis .
these measure can be finance by payment committee european social fund .
i join rapporteur in emphasise particular importance objective this be vital for facilitate convergence all european region .
this report focus on contribution eu regional policy to resolve economic crisis .
objective eu 2020 strategy must also be drive force behind this issue .
this be guideline which frame and enhance eu 2020 strategy for intelligent , sustainable and inclusive growth .
cohesion policy , through structural fund and or action , be prime importance .
territorial cohesion help boost competitiveness various region so as to make they as attractive as possible .
it also provide perfect condition for entrepreneurship and develop sme .
aim be to mobilise resource and tool require for grant financial support at local and regional level .
positive response to combate financial and economic crisis have demonstrate importance eu regional policy .
i fully welcome this report .
i abstain from vote on report .
however , i have my doubt about fixation on competitiveness that pervade document .
this be to be do within regional policy budgetary framework .
no proper impact assessment have be carry out in this regard .
they currently overlap one another , result in lack clarity .
it be important that these instrument be not solely use as fire fight intervention .
implementation cohesion policy program should be speed up in order to help these region at this time .
however , it seem preferable to i to abstain on amendment all this have to do with vote at second reading .
very many bus service in ireland be run by local carrier , small business and family business .
rural bus service be vital to rural life .
passenger should not suffer because this proposal , either because more restrict service or higher price .
i support this regulation concern passenger rights in bus and coach transport .
persistence vary level passenger protection depend on form transport be use be unacceptable .
i therefore vote in favor report on passenger rights in bus and coach transport .
member state unfortunately work hand in glove with transport operator , and oppose stronger passenger rights .
we note that approve change also improve on previous version , by guarantee , in particular
that carrier need to heed appropriate access condition for people with disability and those with restrict mobility
these service should also be accessible to people with disability
bus passenger can not and must not be only one not to be protect by union regulation .
i vote in favor and i congratulate mr cancian on he report , which i feel be thorough .
in most case , in fact , bus transport be operate by small enterprise .
i therefore fully support mr cancian poss proposal and he very well balanced approach .
journey have be considerably democratise in recent year , and we have to be pleased about that .
i vote in favor cancian report concern rights passenger in bus and coach transport .
now we go into conciliation .
therefore , we have vote in favor .
concern with report vote be follow
in several amendment , responsibility compliance be address to port authority .
i also appreciate fact that exceptional circumstance be take into account in this report .
even if these circumstance remain extraordinary , they can pose serious problem to traveller when they arise .
this report also aim to facilitate assistance , retransportation , reimbursement and compensation for passenger in such circumstance .
all this have to do with vote at second reading .
it be crucial that consumer be give effective rights to ensure that liberalisation allow for real choice .
i would like to point out that safety condition can not be neglect and make relative in any circumstance .
complaint system should be accessible and clear to passenger .
combate exclusion be priority for eu .
i therefore believe that rights passenger with disability and reduce mobility should be firmly guarantee .
new rights afford to passenger on boat and ship be to be welcome .
this mean that there need to be investment in terminal and port .
these passenger should also have opportunity to submit compensation claim .
in this case , too , it be primarily about accommodate people with particular need .
however , we do not consider european legislation to be right instrument for protect passenger rights .
nerland itself be best place to make tailor policy .
this compel we to vote against this proposal .
for these reason , i vote in favor amendment table to council poss position .
as be case with airline industry , passenger deserve to be protect against disruption .
consumer rights must be protect .
this legislation be head in right direction , give more rights to passenger travel by boat other coach .
passenger on maritime transport will have rights similar to those stipulate in european legislation for aeroplane and train passenger .
i welcome adoption regulation concern travel by sea and inland waterway .
i hope that acceptable compromise can be reach in conciliation .
in order to solve increase road infrastructure problem , there be proposal to deploy advance information and communication technology .
effectiveness use information and communication technology in sphere road transport be indisputable .
correct function internal market must be ensure .
i vote for this document , because it would accelerate implementation intelligent transport system solution .
approval this draft legislative resolution be important step towards deploy intelligent transport system .
if intelligent traffic system be actually implement , they must be interoperable .
some thought be also give to mutual recognition and datum protection , hence why i be give my approval .
green efa have support jensen recommendation onintelligent transport system .
agreement with council be adopt and directive have be finalize at second reading .
i be pleased that it be adopt with resounding majority .
thus , formality require by eu legislation should be simplify and harmonise .
create large european transport area without barrier be essential .
vert ale group support sterckx report on formality for ship at seaport .
agreement with council be thus adopt and directive have be finalize at first reading .
eu airline industry be already in dire strait .
better performance and higher environmental standard be be seek in this report .
in my opinion , definite target must be set if significant result be to be achieve .
transport be responsible for 25 % co2 emission in europe .
it be crucial to have cleaner vehicle and more efficient transport system in order to reduce this impact .
reality be bit different , however .
there be not much evidence collective ambition .
transport sector be great importance in european internal market .
this sector effectively enable free movement people and goods throughout eu .
i would therefore like to point out that decarbonisation transport should be priority .
in this context , it be worth note possibility internalise external cost .
grosch report be excellent start point as we await european commission white paper .
report call for safer , more efficient transport which cause less pollution .
in other word , nothing but very conventional and very obvious thing .
today poss vote call for more join up think across whole europe .
i endorse final version report .
instead make fund more flexible , we have obtain fund which have no flexibility at all .
i would like to thank fellow member who vote to reject amendment transport have multifunctional nature , with direct influence on economic , social and territorial matter .
i vote for this report because i support aim european transport policy .
i be vote against this report .
it also contribute to development and consolidation internal market .
we be as far away as ever from achieve sustainability in transport .
this report be basically almost rehash old , unfulfilled strategy .
that be why i abstain .
european economy , and therefore employment , depend on sustainable future transport .
vert ale group vote in favor .
we support resolution despite risk pose by overly extremist stance already take by parliament .
we must balance need to protect environment with current economic crisis we be experience .
we look positively on heavy emphasis on safety .
this report will affect forthcoming green paper on integrate transport policy .
i vote against report , as it advocate total liberalisation transport policy .
unfortunately , however , finances allocate to this sector be inadequate .
this be why i vote against amendment however , effect financial crisis on transport sector should not be overlook .
there be more to transport than merely truck , traffic and tariff .
it also boost employment .
i be please to hear result today poss vote .
grosch report have propose achievement unusually ambitious objective by 20 i could not , however , agree with one rapporteur poss proposal .
i have doubt about proposal to create transport fund .
parliament be directly elect by public .
this allow assessment to be make impact european legislation on everyday life citizen .
i believe that it be vital to create incentive for greater participation .
it be clear that european legislation have direct impact on public .
i vote in favor annual report by committee on petition .
thus , outcome could have be better .
this be therefore instrument democracy and citizenship .
i do have one small regret that french citizen make very little use this procedure .
accord to report , 46 % submit petition in 2009 be deem inadmissible .
this be far too high number .
petition be important because they give european parliament means to connect with its constituency and vice versa .
these objective must be maintain through sustain effort from both member state and european commission .
this own initiative report aim to identify current difficulty and to propose some solution .
as i be completely in agreement with these objective , i vote in favor this report .
course , this be not just question affirm these objective loudly and clearly .
my amendment to text be insert in this vein .
in actual figure , this mean that nearly 6 million young people be currently unemployed .
only possible outcome from this be needless long term burden shoulder by european and national budget .
it be up to member state to invest in job creation at political and economic level .
other social and economic risk and cost to we society be associate with this pre eminent problem youth unemployment .
i feel that we can not be resign to lose young european to social exclusion .
it be unacceptable that some member state be plan lower minimum wage for young people .
economic crisis have , course , also result in higher unemployment in european union .
impact this have be heaviest on young people and person approach age retirement .
unemployment among young people be huge problem .
mr turunen poss report be first step , and i fully support it .
youth unemployment be one most press problem face europe .
at same time , eu must be unite when it come to common strategy .
coherent combination educational , financial , social and employment policy be require .
that be why we abstain .
people under 25 be first to be affect by current economic crisis .
it be certainly important to tighten regulation on internship .
representative german free democratic party in european parliament have support this .
this be unsustainable situation .
internship should not destroy job .
we believe that this give wrong message .
it should still be possible to do three month unpaid internship , for example .
there be numerous non profit make other social organization where young person can acquire exciting , interesting experience .
however , such organization be often unable to pay any remuneration for internship .
key factor should be duration internship .
from then on , remuneration should also be pay .
decision make today be impracticable and go too far .
we therefore do not support this part resolution .
young people should not remain unemployed more than four month this be statement with which i agree .
youth unemployment be one europe poss most press problem .
all member state must take action and fight youth unemployment by take national specificity into account .
we must ensure growth and create new job , especially for young people and prioritise business education provider cooperation .
i vote today for own initiative report on combate youth unemployment .
by adopt this report , we have decide to take strong action against abuse internship .
commission and member state be ask by parliament to recommend minimum standard for internship .
european quality charter on internship be to be propose .
i be therefore in favor promote status internship .
this send out clear signal to we young european .
we often say that young people be future europe .
it be awful that youth unemployment rate be double average european rate .
unfortunately , outlook be not promise either .
unemployment among young people be one europe poss most press problem .
that be why i vote as i do .
it be mainly young people and woman who be affect by unemployment .
this trend continue to grow during recession .
actual process get on job ladder be become increasingly difficult .
insecure job mean that we should not be surprise at low birth rate .
let we try , with council and commission , to guarantee young people decent wage .
crisis have hit hardest at those who be just enter labor market .
i have no doubt that unemployment among young people be currently one eu poss biggest problem .
even if young people do find work , they be very often only give temporary contract .
internship be also cause much emotion .
european union must have common strategy .
this specific paragraph for whole europe have be add at particularly difficult time for young people .
in ideal world , youth unemployment would be outlaw .
since 2000 , youth unemployment in brussels have never fall below 30 % .
that be thrust turunen report .
it sketch new way to curb youth unemployment .
we must also ensure that these be good quality .
report be adopt with large majority in favor .
it be fundamental for europe future to guarantee full and secure employment for young people .
europe must have courage to invest in those business which do not relocate but create job .
vocational training be indispensable .
there should be quality charter to ensure that apprenticeship provide reasonable income and be limited duration .
address this be important task for responsible politician .
with 21.4 % young european under 25 unemployed , it be definitely time to take action .
in lithuanium , last year , every eleventh young person be unemployed compare to every twenty fourth in 200we need to boost youth employability by help adapt educational skill to labor market need .
support measure such as quality internship , apprenticeship and traineeship can aid smooth transition from education to employment .
for lithuanium , it be vital to prevent increase brain drain skilled labor .
i vote in favor gruny report , whose aim be to launch vast european employment initiative .
my contribution be base along two line .
firstly , importance link between training course and need labor market .
it also promote view thatself employmentus type work that should be promote .
i be vote in favor bulk measure propose in this report .
these have greater impact on young people and woman .
first relate to need for increase investment in skill and professional and lifelong training .
these worker be often deny important rights include right to training or to join trade union .
crisis should not serve as pretext for development more precarious employment .
all worker should have access to equal treatment regardless they employment contract .
i fully support report and i will vote in favor its adoption .
inflexible model labor law have prove to have fail .
society have evolve , world have change , and labor relation must necessarily accompany this change .
set basic rights for all employee should be secure , regardless employment status .
i still advocate urgent extension protection to work undertake in atypical form employment .
eu can not abandon its european social model , but should rather strengn it .
many report poss article be example this , namely , when it say that it
unemployed people and worker must not expect welcome from brussels quite opposite !
crisis must not serve as pretext for development casual work .
all employee must be protect by labor law , whatever form they contract take .
today poss labor market and its associate employment relationship be characterise by one word flexicurity .
i therefore support mr gruny poss report .
i today vote in favor gruny own initiative report on atypical employment contract in eu .
this allow we to send out two clear message to labor market .
atypical employment contract must remain exception in europe .
transition must be make to stable , protect , better quality employment contract .
fast pace structural change necessitate more flexible form work .
abuse atypical employment breach european social model .
dialogue and collective negotiation can contribute greatly to improve and preserve labor market .
report adopt well define guideline and specific measure for safeguard job , ensure high quality employment throughout europe .
european union be face major financial , economic and social crisis .
report as adopt in committee have be adopt in plenary .
text be not damage but relatively weak .
there be , unfortunately , no chance to secure majority for it .
incidence atypical employment contract be increase significantly in european union .
analysis present in gruny report be therefore good and to be welcome .
we therefore go further in we alternative resolution .
there must not be two class employment contract .
that resolution do not make it , and parliament pass up opportunity to construct stronger social europe .
action be certainly desirable , therefore , and so i welcome position whole european parliament .
this be important .
neverless , i believe that eu should not involve itself in form employment .
this be matter that must instead be deal with at national level .
in my home country , collective agreement to deal with these matter be negotiate by autonomous party .
increase resource efficiency in europe be among priority objective eu 2020 strategy .
allow i to give you one example this .
bioga be precious resource use to produce electricity and fuel for transport and for supply gas network .
bio waste have role to play in more global matter fight against climate change .
we must therefore totally separate bio waste from standard waste , which be worst solution in long term .
instead , we should use it for composting or for produce bioenergy , as report strongly emphasise .
finally , there be great diversity between member state in term current management bio waste .
in order to manage bio waste effectively , priority should be waste prevention or reduction .
effective bio waste management can contribute to eu target at least 20 % renewable energy by 20selective collection and recycle bio waste be essential to europe poss sustainable development .
new legislation should stipulate requirement for system selective bio waste collection and recycle .
treatment waste be problem that affect europe and all humanity .
firstly , i would like to congratulate rapporteur , mr fernande , for he excellent work .
current legislation in term bio waste do not answer requirement material poss regulation .
efficient management bio waste not only bring environmental benefit but also contribute positively to social and economic sphere .
i be therefore vote in favor this report poss proposal .
ever greater area be experience irreparable soil degradation here .
globally , bio waste be most often put in landfill and only tiny percentage be sort and reprocess .
european now understand need to sort waste .
however , bio waste almost always end up in landfill .
report deal with issue adequately , and i will vote in favor its adoption .
it be estimate that amount bio waste produce in eu every year be around 100 million tonne .
we position be ambitious and realistic .
although we broadly agree with these principle , we can not , however , neglect to point out some problem .
question unanswered in report be who will pay ?
reduction be one best way combate problem relate to waste .
as regard composting , it be not enough to say that we need to do it .
satisfactory management bio waste would therefore have not only environmental advantage , but also economic one .
action must be take at eu level and today poss vote should ensure that progress be make .
this report take right approach .
i will therefore abstain .
bio waste can also be reuse to produce bio energy and biofuel .
recycle industry currently create around 250 job for each 10 000 tonne waste recycle .
one strategic objective waste management policy be to transform eu into recycle society .
this mean that sustainable development can be promote through efficient resource management .
draft report already contain most relevant issue for we green .
this be include in recital text adopt in committee .
we be in favor commission poss green paper on management bio waste .
correction to vote and vote intention see minute
approval minute previous sit see minute
economic governance in eu and eurozone , and surveillance national budget debate
mr president , lady and gentleman , economic governance constitute crucial challenge for future we union .
commissioner oll i rehn then discuss this with you during he hearing .
unfortunately , crisis have show that we be right .
as result , commission provide detailed proposal on 12 may .
these proposal do not involve change treaty .
we must act now , within legal context that we have today .
this be not limitation .
we citizen , we business and we economy be demand that we take initiative .
it be we responsibility to decide and to act now .
because economic crisis , european union have be face with series serious test .
as i say this morning , deal be within reach in come day .
we response to crisis be holistic one .
we stabilise , we consolidate and we modernize .
we prepare we social market economy to ensure better future for we citizen .
but for now , let i focus on governance .
we have treaty provision in place which allow we to act .
we have institution .
we need to make it work .
we face real risk and we successfully resist it .
now we be fill in gap we have identify to pre empt such risk for future .
i first announce to parliament idea we flesh out in commission communication 12 may .
we debate since then be reflect in commission communication 30 june .
this work have help to build real european momentum .
i hope that this will translate later into swift consideration and swift adoption legislative proposal .
we approach to economic governance be to have rule that be more comprehensive and more efficient .
we need stronger surveillance regime .
what do this mean in detail ?
first , we need more coordination .
key to this be european semester .
it will enhance economic transparency and encourage peer review , ex ante , among member state .
second , we need credibility that come with better enforcement .
this mean refine incentive and sanction toolbox , more effective mix both preventive and corrective action .
i want to be very clear on this .
parliament can be reassure that commission will do its utmost to ensure that this will be case .
timing measure be also key .
we must not fall into trap wait too long before sanction kick in .
incentive and sanction must be bring upstream so that action be deploy before situation get out hand .
preventive action can be much more effective than corrective action but it require discipline and political will .
we be address this in we proposal , in particular , as regard euro area .
third , we surveillance need to capture all key element .
it must not be restrict to fiscal policy alone .
we have see that such narrow perspective do not work .
we must have tool to detect macro economic imbalance among member state .
such imbalance weaken cohesion eu and , in particular , euro area .
comprehensive scoreboard indicator will give we what we need to identify increase divergence and to propose remedy .
they need , course , to be complement by appropriate enforcement mechanism for such remedy .
european council endorse it fortnight ago . about .
i would like to underline historic dimension reform we be put forward .
this be not just addition different strategy .
applause
president barroso , commissioner rehn , you proposal be important step towards strengn economic governance in europe .
it also wish to cooperate on take next step towards community method .
we have great expectation european semester and coordination national action program .
important reform and painful measure in member state be necessary in order to strengn they competitiveness .
this will create job and prosperity for we citizen .
you call series measure atoolbox .
great deal will depend on specific contents this toolbox .
one we dutch football team have mottodeed not word .
fiscal stability can not exist in isolation from strong economic growth and high level employment .
in you proposal last week , i think you be miss point .
you have leave out several highly relevant option that would really mean qualitative leap in this field .
second , you must come forward with economic policy agenda for job and fiscal consolidation .
today , we only have agenda for cut deficit at expense job .
taxation on labor be far too high in number member state .
i hope you will reconsider and come forward with more balanced set proposal in autumn .
commission have initiative here .
neverless , mr president , some question remain concern this package .
first question , which be fundamental , be who will manage this economic governance ?
we can not just say that we will reduce deficit .
fourth element be stress test .
i be satisfy with fact that decision have be take to publish these .
this be crucial point .
furthermore , this element be repeat in commission poss proposal .
member state have not yet understand .
mr president , many thanks for make this statement .
it also specifically mention imbalance .
until recently , it be still almost impossible to talk about imbalance seriously .
this obviously mean economic governance and also talk about tax issue .
these must stop be taboo subject and obviously have place in such statement .
secondly , it be not enough to coordinate budget policy only in way it be describe .
we must ensure that budget policy be ant i cyclical , enable it therefore to counteract crisis .
unfortunately , this do not feature in text .
unfortunately , you be still lack courage to explain thing as clearly as be necessary .
we have problem with asset price and bubble .
this be not mention explicitly either .
it be no longer enough now to make progress in this crisis .
we need to arrive at consensus .
outcome need to be fully implement by all 27 member state and be fully comply with .
recent financial and economic crisis have necessitate bold measure .
i do not agree with this conclusion .
both commission and council be call for further control and penalty for member state in deficit .
this have not work in past and will not work in future .
regulation financial market be matter urgency .
we will do we part to resolve situation .
europe poss citizen already have to pay council now ought finally to swing into action as well .
this may stall growth in euro area , which be still feeble and at risk .
these country must make greater effort to strengn they domestic market and boost demand instead .
what be need be to carry out fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its condition .
i think you have urgent appointment .
you be in such pickle actually , be you not ?
what in fact happen when you introduce it be that you actually tear up you own rule book .
you throw it away !
i be not johnny come lately to demise euro .
it be always write in rune , as it be .
to suggest now that we have only just find out that greece be break be intellectually dishonest .
we commercial bank have get themselves into terrible problem because they buy junk debt .
they redistribute junk debt repackage at triple rating .
what be we central bank do now ?
very same thing .
you have promise convergence and harmonisation european country .
today , you be rush we towards social and political explosion .
errare humanum est , perseverare diabolicum to err be human , to persist be devil .
first all , to corien wortmann kool , thank you for you support .
that be precisely we goal with youth 20so we proposal be not only about prudence in macro economic aspect .
that be why i also do not agree with idea that we approach be not balance .
we will come with formal proposal .
what be go on be very important reform .
but we also want to include in this holistic approach macro economic surveillance with tif .
it be not only about sanction for those who do not fulfil criterion depth and deficit .
we will also try to reinforce coordination in term macro economic imbalance .
we need this since we whole reform be base on this new architecture .
in last few day , new belgian presidency have renew momentum towards deal .
there be predominant sense constructive pragmatism on both side .
i be grateful for ambition parliament have be demonstrate .
i be grateful for you strong support .
i believe it now appear within grasp .
commission have contribute through various compromise text and be very pleased that progress be be make .
we now call on both colegislator to maintain positive dynamic .
president obama say in g20 that he get bipartisan agreement .
great , and we welcome that .
finally , some you speak about stress testing .
at last european council , i make strong plea to make result public .
fully transparent stress test provide opportunity to do so .
so , as you see , we be act on several front .
i believe that stability euro be in interest all we citizen .
applause
president barroso , thank you for you approach and for you cooperation with european parliament .
debate be close .
write statement rule 149
i welcome proposal make by commission .
europe be about mutual and close interdependency .
however , control mechanism be not solution but just means .
they should not be overestimate .
solution be in more efficient work , entrepreneurship and innovation .
key to solution be prevention .
special attention should be pay to budgetary framework and state debt .
instead break financial control into smaller cluster , monitoring macro economic situation as whole be need .
new dual system incentive and sanction deserve support .
i also encourage make better use eurostat .
reliable and timely datum be crucial component to make right decision .
i should like to draw fellow membersattention to problem national budgeting .
this be all result illogical and unclear tax legislation .
in individual case , tax authority personnel can apply thisturbidlegislation in any way they choose .
this have lead to bankruptcy many business and commercial structure .
what be happen in tax sphere in latvium today can be describe in one word illegality !
in essence , state be deprive entrepreneur they liquid fund .
next item be joint debate on follow
mr president , at origin this financial crisis be national supervisor .
at this stage , and with huge crisis we be suffer , there be only two possibility .
uk split main financial regulator and give more power and more clout to bank england .
mr osborne say that it have fail to prevent crisis because no one know who be in charge .
to close my speech , this be not time for debate on second order reform .
applause
trialogue begin follow day .
when include this item in this plenary sit , we have anticipate complete negotiate process by this date .
as colegislator , we need to continue make effort , as this agreement be still possible .
this leave some leeway for reach compromise at first reading within next few week .
it be not case , therefore , regular , generalise review .
commission have be give necessary power to ensure its adoption within anticipate timeframe .
all competence and power have be incorporate into sectoral legislation .
i hope that negotiation on this directive can be bring to satisfactory conclusion .
parliament have follow message , which be support by large , overall majority .
since then , we have have wide range discussion about many issue .
they also would have expect these authority to be grant strong investor and consumer protection rights .
this be decision we have come to now in parliament .
there also seem , fortunately , to be broad consensus that this step be necessary .
we also insist in parliament on new authority receive rights allow they to ban risky financial product .
this be another case where we have to fight against suggestion be water down .
key point remain if real financial crisis break out , who declare emergency ?
will council ever do this ?
it be insist that fox should be put in charge henhouse .
this do not make any sense , fact which commission have also continually point out .
so far , council appear inflexible .
it must be case large sum be allocate by means decision at european level .
it be now over to council .
since then , commission have do its work .
it commission report from jacque de larosi?there .
first , there be issue concern efficiency .
we do not need safeguard clause .
on this question , i would neverless like to make comment .
who do member state want to protect themselves from when they plan safeguard clause against europe ?
we also want these authority to be locate in single place , for reason efficiency .
on this matter , we have also make some request .
we have also ask for greater openness from these body .
i would like to say one final word relate to unite state .
i be always shock when people tell we that american have pull ahead .
i also notice that number government be have discussion in two stage .
first , we refuse any federal state .
we refuse any new stage integration and we decry community method .
then , later , we always compare ourselves to unite state .
there come time when we have to abide by we responsibility .
i want stronger europe .
madam president , cassandra have gift that tell future .
she also bear curse that not be listen to .
for this reason , troy fall .
they can only be supervise by european authority .
we do not take heed this , and crisis erupt .
exotic product , unknown even to they creator , flood market .
nobody trust anybody else , nobody lend to anybody else , and credit dry up .
now what ?
parliament have give great deal ground in order to reach agreement commission too .
belgian presidency have show great willing .
it have ask we for time .
there be several idea that parliament would like to highlight .
what do it mean to say that they be european ?
national supervisor can not be feudal lord invest with absolute power .
this govern everything except systemic institution .
lifeboat should be make ready before voyage , not in middle storm .
what can not happen be for taxpayer to have to carry can again .
council have ask for time .
parliament have give it time .
let nobody be confuse , however this be not sign weakness .
this be sign strength this house .
it must not make use this time to try and put together block minority in opposition to parliament .
i ask council to listen to cassandra for once .
today , cassandra be rapporteur who have speak .
cassandra be also commissioner barnier .
those who be not cassandra know only too well to whom i refer .
listen to parliament , seek agreement , say here what be say in toronto .
do not say one thing here and another there .
god and this house .
it remain most comprehensive piece sectoral financial service legislation vote on in this parliament .
as such , solvency i i be intimately link with proposal for eiopa .
it be perhaps because my experience with solvency i i that i be keen to take on this report .
i know that it be context in which we could make solvency i i really work .
insurance be not banking and i be glad that my fellow rapporteur have accept that .
they will not be different but they will be balance .
this be real gain for parliament .
for pension , question be up in air .
we need to attribute wider power intervention to supervisor .
we need to prepare contingency plan .
this entire process take time for 27 member state .
however , around 50 12 000 bank operate europe represent 70 % asset .
this mean enormous concentration risk , but also opportunity to intervene primarily in they .
as you well know , latest trialogue actually take place yesterday evening .
should chair esrb be elect , or should he other she be automatically ecb president ?
should president efc participate in work esrb ?
there again , agreement be not far away .
i count on you support on these very important endeavor .
there be many subject which be part this architecture prevention , crisis management and supervision .
there be also financial corporate governance and banking capital .
i will come back to this when talk about mr karasreport .
i would like to say few word on two subject for today .
first , i will address supervision , which be effectively backbone .
we need this credible european architecture supervision .
we find here spirit and philosophy commission poss proposal .
i be think reinforcement joint committee , as advocate by mr skinner .
these be only few example most difficult thing still lie ahead we .
margallo they marfil say . garc ?
we need council to understand that now be time to act and to make progress .
other have also say this .
ball be in its court to use these few day to reach intelligent and credible agreement .
you can count on i to be available .
i have myself believe in precautionary measure for long time .
that be spirit toolbox that we will be present to council minister .
i make commitment that legislative text will be present to you .
i would like to say that i be speak as shadow rapporteur for opinion .
there have be different approach adopt at national level .
it be obvious that this can not work .
what citizen want be for effective decision to be make to get problem resolve .
council only take narrow minded approach .
public do not find this policy acceptable .
we expect council to take action .
this mean he can issue warn , make recommendation , and all this in public .
i really do regard this as extremely positive move which should be highlight .
madam president , commissioner , european supervision financial market be minimum that we can do .
it will require regulation rating agency .
as result , issue control have not be resolve control must be political .
it be also insufficient if we do not take real measure against flight capital to tax haven .
regulation at european level be useful , but insufficient .
we must have global supervision financial market .
we can not simply allow thing to carry on in this dysfunctional and incoherent manner .
equally , new european framework must radically improve both quality and coherence regulatory supervision .
we member state be right to resist such move .
uk and germany be right to adopt position that they have .
let we now begin debate with political group speaker .
problem have already be explain .
we be deal with market which operate globally nowadays .
member state still believe that they can use they national supervisory structure to apply rule in this environment .
this be task to which we have commit ourselves as european parliament .
as be well know , european parliament be not army extremist make revolutionary demand .
we proposal be those de larosi?there , not robespierre , as fine commissioner barnier know .
friend in council , even if you be not here , you will read we word .
dear friend in council , do not bury you head in sand like ostrich .
reality be tough , but it must be face with choice courage and strength .
if they be toxic , why authorise they ?
it be obviously ask for binding action .
all this do not seem to i to amount to extremism .
i can think no other name for that than political federation .
here lie essence entire debate on financial architecture and supervision financial architecture .
we have currency union .
citizen sit here and watch we may quite rightly ask so what be you solution ?
we need to do something without give you say .
in my opinion , that be wrong approach .
council and government do not want strong intervention rights .
mr giegold be right when he describe what be currently go on asparochial .
we will get fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable exercise proper control over financial market .
this would be just first step to status quo ante .
it be finally time for grandiose promise to be back up by action .
my group support strong european regulation .
i wonder , however , wher road we be about to embark upon be right one .
finally , i be convince that politics should take more responsibility .
de madam president , european union already have around 40 eu agency .
every year , these organization gobble up eur 1.5 billion .
council and member state have never have any problem make quick fire decision to establish such agency .
most all , there be frequently no rationale give for these agency .
unfortunately , they often take ridiculous stance .
in this debate on european supervision , parliament have play this role .
why be this ?
in these trouble time , european systemic risk board must get to work as quickly as possible .
however , this be only start .
unity european single market must also be supervise if we want to avoid its fragmentation .
they be also concentrate more on substance than on turf war .
standardise derivative will be trade on establish exchange and force through clear house .
we be discuss how to distribute power between european institution and national institution .
well , solution be quite easy .
instead , oversight should begin in we country .
in italy , for example , it happen via system local branch which can monitor situation well .
furthermore , why should headquarters european agency be in frankfurt ?
who decide that ?
it should also contribute to emergence single banking market union .
i be glad that it appear that we be close to agreement .
in retrospect , it seem astonishing that we do not have single eu wide macro prudential body do just this .
i be extremely pleased to see how close we be to final agreement .
we should all , and rapporteur themselves , be very proud .
de madam president , we need more supervision financial market in europe too .
economic and financial crisis have make it glaringly and painfully obvious that opportunity be miss in past .
european financial supervisory authority must be provide with extensive power .
they must not degenerate into empty shell which passively observe market development .
council must finally accept european parliament as legislator equal standing .
there have certainly be no lack preparatory work by responsible mep .
numerous discussion have take place and work have be carry out in parliament quickly and purposefully .
we be now wait for council to provide clear answer and concrete proposal in write .
hu crisis have teach we all some painful lesson .
new supervisory authority will serve exactly this purpose .
parliament should also make concession .
finally , ecofin should be grant right to announce economic crisis .
fr madam president , i be happy to find my friend michel barnier in this chamber .
i be think international public banking establishment and , in particular , european investment bank .
datum which will be collect by those three institution will be very important and will be partially confidential .
we must do everything in we power so that this do not happen again .
we need regulation and supervision .
we need independent , strong authority in interest european .
what unite state have succeed in do , european union must also do .
this be only way open to we to change thing , and this be why we must succeed .
however , effort to create stricter regulation and closer supervision will not , by themselves , prevent potential crisis .
we need more involvement from europe .
proposal table by commission already provide minimum scenario .
we need strong supervision with tooth , right intervention and mediator function .
we need decision without further notice in emergency .
we require banking supervision as part crisis management .
we need strong supervision with tooth .
it be very good that union be not passive in ensure financial security .
let we remember to link responsibility union to responsibility all member state .
these intervention rights be restrict to absolutely exceptional case and will hopefully never be use .
we want to keep systemic risk permanently to minimum .
for sake taxpayer , we need more involvement from europe , not less .
if they fail to perform , they have somebody to answer to .
that be key message .
i would like to conclude by say that i have no problem with institution be base in frankfurt .
after all , germany have be better model financial propriety than many other .
problem be that we ignore asset inflation .
i will report all those matter to he which may concern he directly .
mr bowle remind we need for early intervention measure .
i think that these be good idea .
we be indeed carry out this reform for citizen .
this be very much reform for citizen .
mr lull mention point which be interest to my colleague , oll i rehn .
mr klinz , i would like to thank you for support that you be show we .
you remind we importance apply we rule properly .
that must be embark upon , mr giegold , well before we talk about ban .
i could imagine important coordinate role for authority in this area .
council also accept that authority may have such role .
mr baldassarre mention worry that mr lehne also have concern power authority .
this have to do with transatlantic calibration that i sometimes mention .
i be not worry about energetic interaction between american and european .
at moment , 80 % financial exchange take place on both side atlantic .
other region world be there , between american and european .
we therefore have same road map .
also , last g20 be something follow up g20 , in my view .
american adopt different method from we own they adopt global package .
they will now need to open drawer one by one to implement these decision .
i think that there be real parallel between american and european .
we be not always use same tool , and we will not always use same method .
we banking sector be quite dissimilar .
i would remind you that in europe , bank finance between two third and three quarter economy .
in unite state , it be other way around .
we do not always have same banking structure .
on this subject , we be have confident dialogue with american , but one without naivety .
that be what i would say in conclusion , and i thank you for you speech .
in my case , i could argue that spain would probably have have big corralito .
euro be create 11 year ago .
i believe that we should make use time and reach speedy agreement .
those who advocate self regulation in past now need to accept self financing .
they have do excellent job , which have not yet bear fruit .
it be pity therefore that my fellow member be no longer present .
however , one thing which be also important to i be this compromise which we be now produce .
parliament table last minute compromise last week .
it do not work if inch be give ultimately result in mile be take .
this method will fail .
i hope that this signal be also clearly understand by absent council .
otherwise , we be all go to find it very uncomfortable next week .
mr president , commissioner , i would like to say three thing .
let we be quite clear .
we have make effort .
this parliament agree to interrupt procedure first reading .
this should not end up as cherry pick .
no .
i can not mention all they .
this be we line this be what we believe in for reason efficiency .
my second remark have to do with date .
it be 1 january with good reason .
we have advantage that we anticipate thing that other institution say later .
president cut off speaker
he repliedno , it be much more serious than that .
i would like to thank everybody who have participate in this .
we have converge from different direction but we have come out with strong parliament voice .
we should be proud .
on international level , we should be proud too .
however , i do not necessarily agree with you on international financial accounting .
you will not be surprise to hear that .
i do not agree with use historical trend .
neverless , on supervision , rapporteur deserve pat on back .
we have go through full time , we be now in extra time .
let we hope it do not have to go to penalty shoot out .
i will try to be very brief here in underline just four point .
special mention for office staff , for susana vravova , and for service committee .
joint debate be close .
vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
write statement rule 149
european union have political , social and moral duty to intervene .
that duty find its justification in value underpin union and enshrine in treaty .
economy can only function with healthy financial market dedicate to it .
european financial stability facility and european financial stabilisation mechanism and future action debate
we be devil that look at detail , and we want more it .
on 11 may , european stabilisation mechanism be establish utilise eu budget .
bit more haste would have be useful , and perhaps cheaper .
can you confirm that rule spv be be change to permit this ?
there remain many other question .
how will coordination between stabilisation fund and imf operate ?
be this all right way around ?
should imf be top up eu rescue , or should it be other way round ?
be spv active now or must first call use eu budget mechanism ?
market force be not popular right now .
mr bowle mention angel .
i do not know if there be many angel when we talk financial service .
first question what amount be we talk about when we talk this european stabilisation mechanism ?
what be link with ceiling on own resource ?
that be precise response that mr rehn want to give to you on this point .
second question will commission carry out impact analysis for these two instrument ?
this report will be transmit to economic and financial committee and council .
notably , it will include impact evaluation text .
third question what be impact on financial capacity eib ?
it will not lend or borrow on behalf this mechanism .
no exact choice legal basis have yet be make .
you have just mention question role european parliament .
european parliament will be keep inform any change regard all these new procedure .
sixth question what be coordination with international monetary fund ?
eighth and final question relate to choice legal basis .
this would have be difficult to reconcile with long procedure involve important role for some national parliament .
however , i wish to say follow on subject .
in we view , financial stabilisation mechanism be not substitute for develop european monetary fund .
financial stabilisation mechanism illustrate urgency financial market reform .
in meantime , market have do they job .
we fellow member , othmar kara , speak stability pact .
today , we have mechanism that be put together in emergency , as you remind we .
we do this in emergency .
president cut off speaker
this be good course action .
thank you for you understanding .
we now move on to speaker in catch eye procedure .
besides , issue arise concern dependency rating agency .
i find , therefore , that this measure have not be think through well enough .
it pose risk again member state run up debt at expense and liability or .
i believe that this be crux stabilisation .
any reduction this program would be totally counterproductive .
would you have suggestion to make on this ?
i would simply like to ask you question , commissioner .
he will do this in write in next few day .
i refer you to quite comprehensive response that president barroso give on this question .
however , this be only tool , mr kara .
these idea will also be turn into legislative proposal at end 2010 and start 20mr ber?s mention application stability pact .
like you , i think that we must go further .
as you have understand , we introduce this european financial stabilisation mechanism in time emergency .
commission have also make important proposal relate to budgetary surveillance .
debate be close .
vote will take place on wednesday , 7 july 2010 at 12 00 .
next item be joint debate on
it will force bank to hold more capital against riskier activity on trading book .
we be constantly tell by bank that they have learn lesson crisis .
it be therefore imperative that these rule on bonus apply in 20colleague , we have duty , as legislator , to defend taxpayersinterest .
we have duty to respond to public poss concern .
we voter demand and expect bank to prioritise stability and lending over bankersown pay and bonus .
in last two year , since 2008 , bank have fail to reform they structure .
to begin with , it be important to exercise and expand sound internal and external supervision remuneration policy .
remuneration itself must reflect company poss long term performance as far as possible .
bonus should not just be guarantee .
proportion variable remuneration should be pay out over sufficient period .
i think that we can go even further in this matter .
i agree with you observation , mr el khadraou i .
there must be binding measure on remuneration policy financial institution .
payment bonus to director bank receive state aid be greatly restrict .
i think that that be fair .
i also welcome fact that these measure must be implement by member state from 1 january 20thi be one key element more robust and more stable regulatory framework .
i have begin this task .
i recently put forward international agenda for financial regulation for growth .
this be one request make in you report , mr el khadraou i .
we shall open two month period genuine consultation on all these issue .
thirdly , there be matter modernisation capital treatment .
i have just refer to crd 3 and issue remuneration .
i be very aware this risk .
i be aware that these negotiation on crd 3 have sometimes be very difficult .
madam president , lady and gentleman , council be again absent .
during negotiation , council come out on side bonus recipient .
european parliament be in favor clear european regulation .
we be in favor maximum limit .
we be in favor payment method involve less risk .
we be in favor liability .
we be in favor restriction on bonus for manager bank support with public fund .
we do not want cash amount to be higher than tie up capital .
we have manage to get we way with splitting timetable .
it be also important that we have adapt trading book and banking book .
we support this compromise as it take we further in right direction .
on other hand , there have be very few specific measure .
this legislation will most likely reduce short sight and exaggerated risk take in financial sector .
that will reduce risk level and increase stability .
it be too risky for society to largely accept status quo .
yes , i mean up there alongside supervisory architecture .
madam president , commissioner , my political group be particularly delighted that this directive have be adopt .
it be directive which arguably contain most ambitious rule in world on remuneration factor .
i must say , commissioner , that commission have largely be on we side in this struggle .
therefore , i think that this be achievement which we can share .
now , there be important issue at stake .
as we lose , we have have to make compromise .
we have here regulation which be unique on global scale .
after all , any manager who be successful and responsible also want to continue make good live .
this be fundamental change towards greater sustainability and cost efficiency , and hopefully away from gambling .
thank you to all fellow member for they cooperation on this report .
it be clear that we need principle that promote and create guideline for sound remuneration policy .
at same time , we must avoid broad generalisation and blame sector as whole .
in end , we succeed in achieve relatively balanced result .
de madam president , mr kara have already mention some key point .
i fully concur with he on they .
i think that we need better capital requirement for financial institution in both qualitative and quantitative term .
however , it do not help to force situation as this could have totally opposite effect .
financial crisis be obviously global crisis .
lesson we need to draw from it must therefore be draw at global level as well .
this mean that if we tighten capital requirement , we must coordinate this measure internationally too .
level play field must be retain .
calculation example in annex must also match wording .
however , future supervisory authority will be responsible for interpretation .
there be one other thing we should not forget .
financial economy and real economy be not two self contain system .
it will not be that easy to put end to this .
attempt to make management executive more accountable with retention be thwart by new insurance policy .
eu draft should draw lesson from this .
factor determine bonus must definitely be transparent .
madam president , i would like to thank rapporteur and commission .
we only know about excess banking sector because disaster that have happen .
transparency be key to all this .
when people have knowledge what be happen , then we can take action on it .
clear rule have be implement which can not be interpret in different way .
this be aim debate we be have with council at this very moment .
this include , mr canfin , decision on rule relate to remuneration .
i should now like to say few word about application these new rule .
they must apply to all investment banking firm .
mr christensen , you stress need for transparency .
mr bowle mention central issue capitalization , as do mr balz short while ago .
capitalization be indeed important .
we need to achieve exactly same objective .
they have be set by gwe must achieve they in parallel , and i shall be careful to ensure that this do indeed happen .
i believe , colleague , that it be begin process , not end .
therefore , i urge colleague to give strong vote to this report in plenary tomorrow .
mr president , lady and gentleman , i too shall keep it brief .
it can not be end story .
it be clear that there be still work to be do .
supervisor must be strengn so as to enable external monitoring , too , companiesremuneration policy .
role shareholder must also be strengn .
debate be close .
vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 7 july 2010 .
question time commission
next item be question time b7 0316 2010 .

do commissioner have comment to make on that ?
i hope that we will be able to make progress in this area .
i be sorry , but begin second question be not very clear .
mr kelly , perhaps you could restate you question very briefly if you would not mind .

you yourself come from wonderful region europe , euregio egrensis .
people be really suffer great deal there .
it would , indeed , be one my priority in this region .

it be unacceptable for this to be enter on parliament poss list in official debate .

on this basis , council will be able to evaluate situation and draw appropriate conclusion .
one they have be mention by you .
we now move back to mr kelly .
it be you second and last supplementary .
it be important to stress that we be not to know , as questioner , that this would happen .
indeed we have be push for debate on mercosur bilateral talk .
i totally agree with what mr mcguinness have just say .
i be very angry , quite frankly , about way this have be do .
it will provide much wider opportunity for debate and discussion .
but let we see how we get on , mr gallagher .
if you want to be patient and wait , we will see how we get on .
unite nation framework offer opportunity for such talk .
european union have no competence to intervene in such case .
ultimately , this regrettable situation result from yet to be resolve cyprus problem .
there should be no pressure from any side .
as mention earlier , this be issue for internal cypriot dialogue .
subject middle east peace
how be commission use european neighborhood policy to bring positive result to bear on this situation ?
i would like to thank commissioner for he reply .
what have you do to raise this question ?
i would like to start where honorable member end .

subject fair trade

commissioner mandelson take up coordination fair trade issue in dg trade in 200do commission plan to keep this responsibility ?
one they biggest asset be that they be non governmental in nature .
i would also recognize that there be considerable scope for consumer confusion .
i be pleased to hear that you be go to coordinate .
thank you for you brevity , commissioner .
as author be not present , question 34 lapse .
subject draft eu colombium free trade agreement
subject eu colombium free trade agreement

novel food debate
indeed , we often hold discussion here on food that have be tinker with .
innovation be all well and good , but not at expense human life and health .
what exactly arenovel food ?
one example this be nanotechnology .
manufacturer would like to place this on market .
consumer always love novelty , and indeed new technology can help we combat obesity , for example .
food should not reach we plate unless its safety be guarantee .
now for stumble block meat from clone animal and they offspring .
clone animal be often cripple or diseased , and most be not even alive when they be bear .
in other word , there be little sign respect for animal welfare .
discussion on clone meat be not new .
european parliament have be debate cloning animal since back in 200 council take view that meat from clone animal should fall under novel food legislation .
therefore , parliament be unable to reach agreement with council at second reading .
therefore , i make emphatic call for separate legislation on cloning animal .
we must not produce any unpleasant surprise at last moment .
i be grateful for parliament poss broad support for improvement proposal to streamline authorisation procedure .
regard animal cloning , i share importance that parliament attach to this highly sensitive issue .
i look forward to hear view member .
it deal with novel food and new process for manufacture foodstuff .
i agree that new definition be need , but we should not limit ourselves to definition and label .
i hope and trust that this will be case .
effect nanomaterial on human body be unknown .
we must do we utmost to guarantee safe consumption .
we represent citizen and we must not forget this fact .
most we would also agree that question transparency be crucial when we address this dossier .
we therefore need to guarantee public access to datum on which risk assessment for novel food be base .
transparency should also apply when we speak about label product from animal feed by gmo .
these be food manufacture use new production technique , food that do not exist before 15 may 199we want commission to present legislative proposal without delay , and we be really push for this .
absent council have accept only very limited number amendment from we first reading .
i hope commission do keep its promise to produce not just report but actual legislative proposal .
i believe this be something european public really need and be call for .
can these thing affect we health ?
if so , should they therefore be include in regulation on medicinal product ?
it make sense to have eu legislation in this area , but there be many different interest involve .
who actually want these new initiative ?
be it industry that want to sell more product ?
or be it really consumer ?
i do not believe it be latter .
in europe , we can easily feed ourselves without need for clone product .
precise purpose these regulation be to safeguard food safety and human health .
unfortunately , however , reality be much duller .
need i remind you that technology be use to obtain such food be still experimental in many respects .
group european people poss party christian democrat can not support she on every point .
we take different view regard additive and animal feed with feed derive from gmo plant .
however , she have do excellent job .
i also want to thank we shadow rapporteur , mr ayuso , for excellent work she have do .
follow important reason be put forward during discussion in group .
we do not need it .
population be very evidently against it , as state by all survey .
i be sure that we be not just talk here about vague gut feeling .
it contain so many unanswered question , justify this sense unease .
clone animal suffer .
they often need to be put to sleep because they have terrible disease .
animal protection be not just principle which we can apply willy nilly .
author treaty have impose this on we .
we must absolutely avoid create law which fail to take animal protection into consideration .
it be for these reason that we will be support it tomorrow too , with large majority .
we have interesting debate too on this regulation , which be also fill with controversy .
commissioner , i believe that you say that we have consensus .
with novel food , we need prior authorisation before they enter market .
this would not conform to concept internal market and uniformity health and live condition .
we be not call for ban on gmo and nanomaterial .
great deal have already be say about meat from clone animal .
i would like you , commissioner , to remove this section from novel food regulation .
this would pave way for regulation on all other topic which be not controversial .
agreement be not reach between party during trialogue .
we all know about extremely rigorous cross compliance rule .
please take into account rather difficult situation currently face farmer and ensure fair competition for european farmer .
this be how we can recognize benefit certain healthier novel food .
i find it regrettable to have only one ideological opinion on issue clone animal .
european commission have pledge to put proposal to we .
do we not already have enough rule govern food ?
we certainly do need it .
if there be go to be novel food regulation , it should really only apply to novel food .
situation be different with regard to nanotechnology , which be new procedure .
however , we should avoid demonise this new technology , as have often happen in past .
we must not stand in way progress .
i be astounded at information that be already available and at research that have be carry out .
we certainly still need to do this with nanotechnology , but opportunity which it open up be huge .
we should continue to utilise and promote they .
i look forward to find out what will be put before we .
these animal have suffer premature ageing or other disease .
clone animal suffer .
most clone organism have not survive other have die prematurely .
success rate be one viable organism in 75 cloning attempt .
last but not least , cloning also raise issue about safety use these technique .
this technique be still too dangerous to be use for direct benefit mankind .
it be serious ethical issue .
we must guarantee that it be safe .
firstly , legislation must have scientific basis .
we decision must be base on relevant research , and on objective and well conduct science .
it must not be question personal taste , religious conviction or particular interest .
consumer will reject novel food if they can not be certain that what we be offer be indeed safe .
citizen europe have right to demand that .
this be at complete odds with innovation and development .
we must not impede or prevent new thing , but we must guarantee that they be safe .
situation in european union regard we meat supply be adequate .
there be no reason , therefore , to have to fall back on meat from clone animal .
meat from clone animal be definitely not prior i harmful .
however , risk can not always be exclude either .
there be no reliable evidence available to show what kind suffer such animal endure .
cloning be clear encroachment on nature and we require clear political decision on this .
not everything that can be make be also for mankind poss benefit .
we must send out consistent , clear political message to commission and we citizen .
another important topic in this regulation be rule on nanotechnology .
i call on commission to table proposal on this as soon as possible .
we only know that this technique cause suffer , hurt and pain to animal , which be often avoidable .
de mr president , i would like to thank rapporteur for she work .
this will take account high level health protection in european union .
stringent regulation and quality standard be constantly be impose on and implement by agricultural sector in europe .
precautionary principle must apply in particular in food sector .
we do not need meat from clone animal for sake food supply security .
as european parliament we should , during forthcoming second reading , .
president cut off speaker
we need new regulation in order to place novel food on market safely .
we certainly do not need meat from clone animal .
there be whole range reason why we do not need this meat from clone animal .
we european citizen , who be we consumer , reject this product .
this be present , on one hand , as scaremongering and , on or , as ant i scientific .
i believe that we will benefit not only we consumer in do so , but also european agriculture .
i , too , would like to express my admiration and thanks to rapporteur .
at present , european group ethic do not see convincing argument to justify .
president cut off speaker
nanotechnology have become widely use in food processing across world .
in europe , we need well develop and research product which we can guarantee be safe for human consumption .
product must be safe , test and approve and label in way that do not mislead consumer .
president cut off speaker
one ask oneself why should we ?
be there perhaps shortage meat stock in europe ?
absolutely not .
this be not valid argument .
be there enough information for consumer ?
can consumer clearly understand and choose which be meat from clone animal and which be not ?
be they , by any chance , safe from scientific point view ?
well , we will be able to say in 50 year .
it take century to work out that penicillin could come from mould .
do europe , perchance , say yes to everything ?
no , because this europe do not want product provenance state , it be against .
president cut off speaker
first , replacement decentralised authorisation procedure with centralised procedure at eu level .
safety assessment would be carry out by efsa and authorisation decision take by commission .
fifth , clarification fact that all food product contain nanomaterial require case by case authorisation by eu citizen .
i look forward to debate with european parliament and council on this .
annex position commission
amendment
indeed , much have be say about this , but novel food regulation be about very much more .
debate be close .
vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
write statement rule 149
animal , moreover , should not suffer for human health .
thank you .
all citizen union be entitle to necessary protection and security in this area .
industrial emission integrate pollution prevention and control recast debate
mr president , this debate be time badly .
i would like to emphasise two aspect .
first be environmental requirement in industrial plant .
i have hear many argument in this debate .
i do not like to remember my past , but i come from former gdr , east germany .
we be not talk about thing which be not available on contrary , this be up to date technology .
this directive represent significant step forward in control industrial pollution in european union .
it also provide we with opportunity to stimulate eco innovation .
mr president , i would like to begin by thank mr krahmer for have push for ambitious legislation .
it be therefore worth vote for .
i be pleased that we succeed in achieve this .
this place germany at competitive disadvantage compare to or .
this be argument that can apply to many aspect environmental legislation .
there have to be level play field .
question be that we have now recast this legislation .
member state have get off hook .
my member state , unite kingdom , have get off hook .
it have not do what germany do .
mr president , i shall keep it brief , as nerland uruguay match be still go on .
i shall keep it brief , then , as i want to catch end game .
in light this , i be truly disappoint with course negotiation .
neverless , when all be say and do , i be definite supporter this tighten up .
at end day , that be what this be all about .
we be to be give level play field and we be to have clean air .
at end day , however , we be make progress .
i believe that match be now over , and that nerland have reach final .
sadly , england could not be there , but never mind we can not have everything .
we have reach , in end , what be acceptable compromise .
member state be not particularly happy .
certainly some member this house be very unhappy .
i hope mr eickhout poss unhappiness be mitigate later but , neverless , it be good overall result .
at end day , that be always consumer .
this be also approach we support for carbon dioxide and or greenhouse gas emission .
this commitment ensure that this vary reality will be observe .
this apply in particular to transitional national plan which will apply to large power plant .
unfortunately , electricity market be not yet single market .
it will take time to achieve that objective .
commissioner , you say it yourself .
after all , previous directive date from 1996 that be , 14 year ago !
thus we have great success , though it be spoil somewhat by large combustion plant .
small fry be arrest , while big fish be allow to go free .
what happen so often in life be also unfortunately happen here with industrial plant .
c it be clearly very important to press for reduction in emission hazardous substance by industry .
this process be very important .
this be least we must do for sake human health and environment .
even after this directive , situation will not really be good anywhere in europe .
around 95 % polish energy sector be base on coal .
adoption krahmer report will put enterprise in difficult situation .
this be economically and technically problematic .
this should be make to apply only to new investment .
it be base on dogmatic principle .
it lead to unsustainable development and unfair competition within european union .
first , degree flexibility be maintain for business and for authority responsible for grant exemption .
installation which come under remit this directive must be authorise .
i think that this directive should be link to european union poss industrial policy .
pl mr president , i would like to comment on two matter .
second matter concern member state with coal base industry and draft directive .
transitional period for large combustion plant concern so2 and nox emission be particularly important to we .
i would like to congratulate all negotiator .
we need control reduction excess bureaucracy so that we can have more efficient activity .
we need concrete and compact guideline which establish eu wide minimum standard .
we need accompany increase in efficiency in order to be able to protect we environment more effectively .
however , we also need independent and objective control body which will ensure adherence to new guideline .
agricultural sector therefore have lead role to play in climate and environmental protection .
industry can now follow .
ro i approve compromise text result from trialogue .
it will allow derogation to be agree from emission value accept and base on best available technique .
these derogation concern case where investment cost outweigh environmental benefit .
upshot all this .
president cut off speaker
it be pity , because it be hugely important directive for both air quality and eu industry .
although we achieve reasonable compromise , company must invest in cleaning technology , which be not necessarily available .
plant will have to be close prematurely and cost to consumer will be considerable .
premature closure plant would represent cost that resultant environmental benefit would not cover .
flexibility be still possible but must now be clearly justified .
commission can collect information on use this flexibility .
you be probably aware that we proposal be for shorter time .
i hope that i have already prove that in first half my mandate .
i think it be fair to say that we give industry time to build change into normal investment plan .
that be what compromise be bring .
fact be that we be move .
it certainly have support commission .
good omen , i think .
who exactly it will be , we will see .
i do not want to express any preference now .
chri davy , many thanks !
that also do not happen every day .
it be certainly worth note .
however , congratulation to we dutch friend , course .
i want to talk about two aspect debate to which i have just be able to listen .
first be that i understand all worry and woe my eastern european friend only too well .
as east german , i be also half eastern european .
in order to get high level environmental protection , one have to be able to afford it .
we must deal with fact that industrial process in asia be always cheaper than here .
those which do not do this will become less competitive .
no one , include this law , be demand that industrial enterprise should be switch off tomorrow .
we have enough transitional period , but to say that we must go without for competitive reason be false .
mr krahmer , congratulation on you excellent work .
debate be close .
vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
write statement rule 149
at moment , we be witness tentative development alternative energy resource in certain region .
this maintain considerable dependency on fossil fuel .
we must find solution enable we to invest in state art energy production facility in least pollute way possible .
industrial activity require high level environmental protection .
this be particularly true for prevention air and water pollution , but also for biodiversity .
main strategy emerge as result be to combat environmental pollution at source .
it be also request to support and monitor member state in implement measure .
in this regard , cooperation with european confederation industry , sme and ngo play important role .
loss to industry may be as high as pln 50 billion .
implementation directive will also have adverse effect on thousand polish business .
this be four year shorter than poland have expect .
extend transitional period would make technological conversion easier for small heating plant .
in view above , recommendation for second reading industrial emission directive should be reject .
obligation operator who place timber and timber product on market debate
these operator must be aware wood poss origin .
parliament would have like ban on entire chain , and not just first seller .
all party must therefore take responsibility for ensure that no illegal timber be sell in eu .
most blatant breach ban on sale illegal timber should be treat as crime .
we examine sort context in which this concept occur in current legislation .
illegal harvesting also destroy biodiversity .
forest be vital importance in maintain biodiversity and in global climate and water cycle .
nowhere be three pillar sustainable development clearer than in relation to forest .
challenge remain as to how we detect illegally harvest timber .
proposal in front you deserve you support .
it certainly have mine .
however , i must say that we work well together .
i would also like to thank spanish presidency .
i have three thing in mind when work on this issue .
firstly , that timber be wonderful and renewable material that we use too little rather than too much .
we must not impose higher requirement on timber than we do on oil , for example .
secondly , it must be possible to implement legislation .
export timber and timber product be important factor in sweden become rich once upon time .
we must not prevent or country that be currently poor from export and trading .
many my objection have be hear , for which i be very grateful .
i think that we have achieve great deal .
i see many friend here who fight hard with we .
this be absolutely absurd .
however , this legislation protect european citizen and european producer from unfair competition from cheap illegal timber .
it be also because today we be send very strong signal to rest world .
this be very important signal on part european union , and should not be underestimate .
deforestation both legal and , in particular , illegal remain major problem in world .
fair be fair , however this signal be actually only effective thanks to european parliament .
as far as i be concern , this be great victory for democracy .
unfortunately , if it be not enforce effectively , it will be paper tiger .
this also go for shadow rapporteur .
in my opinion , parliament have set example how it can operate and express its democratic power .
i be very happy to have be part successful negotiation to secure agreement .
it be possible to come to such agreement when we all work together .
i would like to highlight one very welcome side effect .
it follow on nicely from what jan be just say .
mr president , commissioner , i would also like to begin by thank rapporteur this excellent work .
we be therefore also talk about transfer wealth from producer to country consuming this timber .
this illegal practice place sustainable timber exploitation and company involve in it at risk .
nice sound word be not enough .
this report take very important step in this direction by define prohibition on timber trading .
good intention be not enough either .
effective means be need , particularly penalty , which could be three type in this case .
however , how far back should we trace timber , and which product be it realistic to check ?
i be think about furniture consist mdf and chipboard that be make recycled wood , for example .
i hope that , with this proposal , we will be able to prevent that from happen .
i hope that commission will put forward proposal relate to this as soon as possible .
it be important for we citizen , judge by my postbag and number e mail i have receive .
civil war in liberium , mainly fund through illegal log , kill 250 000 people .
human rights watch say that usd 2 billion have be lose in tax revenue in indonesium .
so what we be do today be first step .
i would like to thank commissioner for go further than he predecessor .
tomorrow , we will make start .
he be sympatic , but he service and lawyer say it could not be do .
it can be do , and here we have proof it .
this be excellent , this be good news and important measure .
what do that mean ?
one see wordseffective , proportionate , dissuasivetime and time again .
i would like you to be first commissioner to actually ensure that those word have proper effect .
de mr president , i think that we be make good legislation today .
it would be much too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence origin throughout entire supply chain within europe .
this be on table at begin debate .
therefore , we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance .
we have succeed in do this .
this be not only applicable to fall , and it will not work .
zero risk be not feasible .
it produce bureaucracy and , above all , produce new risk .
in this sense , this compromise be good one .
i be pleased that we will be able to approve it with large majority tomorrow .
we be surely all unanimous on that issue .
that should not be purpose at all .
that , too , be now something to make we apprehensive .
this be important example how we should not work .
we have quite bit to do in this area in future .
we must try to avoid sort problem that we have in connection with this issue in particular .
this be why it be imperative for europe to improve legislative framework in this area .
however , it be not perfect solution .
there be option for bypass even this system .
however , further measure be .
president cut off speaker
after all , 20 % to 40 % worldwide industrial timber production come from illegal source .
around 13 million hectare forest be deforest every year , as we have already hear today .
i would like to thank rapporteur .
decent society create sensible rule .
decent people respect they , and decent government should not have problem with prosecute thief .
it be therefore necessary .
president cut off speaker
on contrary , it be because high level consensus in room .
and , yes , it be also important part fight against poverty .
impact regulation depend on effective implementation , and challenge be far from over .
we be clearly deal with proposal noble nature .
i be look forward to engage in implementation and enforcement process together with you .
i be glad that we have make possible what he think impossible at time .
many have be and be concern about bureaucracy .
company should have document need for this in any case .
it be require , for example , under law on vat .
they need to be genuinely effective in prevention malpractice .
debate be close .
vote will take place tomorrow , wednesday , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 .
write statement rule 149
nowadays , 20 30 % industrial timber production worldwide be from illegal source .
we need to clean up european timber market as soon as possible .
while it could still be improve , propose regulation be ambitious and courageous .
regulation establish binding provision which delegate responsibility on basis due diligence system .
in many case , we see illegal extraction even in european union country .
this be link to management animal , especially taller one .
it be appropriate to resolve these question at corresponding national or regional level .
confederal group european unite leave nordic green left will certainly support rapporteur poss proposal .
illegally harvest timber and timber product have no place on we market .
this be also human rights issue .
last week , dutch television show how we energy company profit from coal mining in south africa .
spokespeople these company be turn blind eye they lack courage to be publicly accountable .
similar practice occur in deforestation sector .
we must eradicate these root and branch .
large scale log drive people from area where they live .
i endorse environmental and climate target , whilst also advocate protection human rights .

future cap after 2013 debate
. be pleased to welcome commissioner ciolo ?
i believe this to be extremely positive detail .
what be cap for ?
why be it still relevant in 21st century ?
that be scale challenge .
that would help to create job and provide real opportunity for farmer to diversify and earn extra income .
it can not be right and justified to continue make payment base on how you farm some 10 year ago .
we also have to address issue market volatility , but on this i would urge some caution .
yes , we still need intervention and private aid to storage .
yes , we need to examine other tool such as risk insurance and future market .
yes , we need we special reserve budget line to fund action in term crisis .
that have already be try and it have fail .
i would suggest that we do not wish to go down that road again .
as far as cross compliance be concern , i think that it have have positive impact on direct payment .
it have also clearly define start point public goods rightly remunerate from public purse .
course , we can simplify cross compliance measure .
as far as we group be concern , this report convey ambition for european agriculture .
agriculture must be support in this evolution .
issue generational change will be one we concern .
report which we will adopt today include proposal table by member represent political group and individual member state .
we need common european agricultural policy .
let we forget any thought renationalisation .
this , course , include find food for nine billion people .
let we not see agriculture as environmental villain and environmental problem .
agriculture and forestry hold fundamental solution to we huge problem .
previous cap reform have lead to liberalisation agricultural market .
they have give rise to profound injustice in distribution aid between country , product and producer .
it be also essential that we maintain second pillar common agricultural policy .
mr president , i would like to thank rapporteur for this report .
future farming and cap must provide farmer with viable secure income .
pillar one payment must continue give farmer direct payment which give they minimum level income security .
distribution cap fund must take into consideration cost production in member state .
this be good thing .
primary function agriculture be and remain production food for we citizen .
farmer be require to produce more and more with less and less .
this be impossible without increase efficiency .
european parliament , commission and council be responsible for secure necessary framework condition for this .
everything else be very worthy , very desirable , but secondary .
we must face up to this problem and solve it .
we can not continue with such great difference in long term .
solve this problem be go to be difficult .
i would like to thank mr smith , who have notice problem with budget .
it be necessary to amend cap to help those who need it urgently .
currently largest proportion go to big owner and to producer .
proper budget for cap be also important , and i express my thanks to mr lyon .
these system can operate and become widespread throughout european union .
commission must commit itself to define budget that be sufficient to achieve these objective .
what be more , at this time crisis , many young people want to return to farming .
i believe that commission must take supportive and flexible approach to help young farmer .
president cut off speaker
i wish to stress in particular article refer to common agricultural policy poss architecture .
cap must continue to be base on its two pillar .
another key point be to maintain cap budget at least at its current level .
however , farmer need support to be able to comply with these standard .
well structure , properly finance common agricultural policy mean safe , good quality food for european .
mr president , i too wish to thank my colleague george lyon for he excellent work on this report .
common agricultural policy must remain common european policy .
secondly transparency and proportionality should be central to future cap .
lastly , european farmer produce food to highest quality and standard .
we also need to ensure level play field , fair competition and future viability european agriculture .
bulgarian and romanian will receive mere 40 % .
at same time , all be operate in common market european union .
i firmly believe that this injustice must be eliminate as soon as possible .
all farmer throughout union must have equal position and same condition for subsidy .
in 1970 , nearly 70 % eu budget be spend on agriculture .
unfortunately , today revise cap be be design under same condition competitiveness as previous policy .
it be insulting that economic crisis be be use as pretext to cut benefit to farmer .
moreover , it be latter who be to blame for today poss condition crisis .
mr president , i declare interest as work farmer .
plan for future cap have to work at practical level and it must be affordable .
if there have to be cap , let it assist farmer and not hinder they .
fr mr president , i understand that you have short and happy night .
what be aim here ?
that be aim .
what do we mean by that ?
reject renationalisation cap and increase cofinancing , that be first point .
fourth element be regulate and prevent market volatility , which i believe be essential .
we must return to this topic and we need to go little further still .
my final point concern first and second pillar .
i be say that this morning because this be debate we be hold .
commissioner , i would like to finish with simple idea .
cap be create at same time as european economic community .
we be now in european union .
i really feel that we ought to have major policy .
president cut off speaker
finally , it need to deliver value for money .
to my mind , that mean we should ensure that fund be use effectively .
rapporteur have produce excellent report .
i congratulate he on he work and be happy to support .
farmer will be pay per hectare for water conservation , thereforestation and so forth .
choice without alternative be no choice at all .
wale have strong history agriculture and many community depend heavily upon farming .
its market orientation will continue as at present .
we need proper safety net .
commissioner , we farmer will once more have to make effort to adapt .
any change that do take place must be accompany by realistic transition period .
i would like to thank mr lyon and all shadow rapporteur for they work .
as you know , rule procedure make provision for five to speak .
in accept new challenge , common agricultural policy must maintain its care for environmental value and food security .
in addition , i propose leave try and test instrument for market regulation untouch .
milk quota be example .
if they be end , what will we replace they with ?
course , there be certain idea , but we do not have any certainty .
president cut off speaker
president cut off speaker
evidence be that , today , europe be net importer agricultural raw material .
furthermore , today we have cap that must be reform for three reason .
it be cap that be unfair , economically , socially and environmentally .
socially aid be unfairly distribute between country , region and farmer .
eighty per cent aid be allocate to 20 % farmer .
environmentally we need cap which respect soil , which respect .
president cut off speaker
that therefore mean that cap require thorough reform and such reform require start from scratch .
yet we farmer be not always reward by market for these contribution to public good .
we therefore need support where market fail .
fact that report call for aid per hectare be positive thing .
this will counteract further intensification agriculture and make achievement environmental target more realistic prospect .
that be how we can reward we farmer .
de mr president , lady and gentleman , agricultural policy need coherent framework .
this must strengn eu as whole , while also take regional difference into account .
there be some enormous challenge face agricultural policy .
i would therefore welcome clear signal on that from commissioner as soon as possible .
new public mechanism for regulate agricultural production will have to be establish to ensure food security consumer .
we be in favor strong cap that have budget it need to achieve its objective .
president cut off speaker
president cut off speaker
president cut off speaker
i have two request to speak in relation to observance rule procedure .
mr mcguinness have floor first .
i will put in write statement on this issue .
i hope you support my point , colleague .
those be rule procedure .
moreover , it be stipulate that five shall speak , although we have give 10 floor .
this be very important issue .
now mr obermayr have floor , also in relation to observance rule procedure .
de mr president , i assume you be refer to i .
course i would like to thank you for you generosity in allow ten speaker rather than five .
we understand you time constraint , naturally , but i hope you will understand we too .
this be very important issue .
there be part europe that be operate under considerable burden and that be under extreme threat .
naturally this be also true beyond work committee .
secondly , you indicate that problem regard catch eyeprocedure have not be resolve .
it would be helpful and fair to put appropriate structure in place as soon as possible .
i beg you indulgence and thank you again for you understanding .
you be absolutely right .
however , there be member here who be constantly get blue card out .
however , i do not wish to prolong debate .
i therefore feel that we need realistic budget .
what we notice be that we be demand more and more we farmer .
we must reflect on how agriculture and agr i food sector can contribute to this .
i also want to send out clear message and to answer mr kelly poss question about direct aid .
therefore , in my opinion , historic reference do not constitute fair , transparent or objective criterion .
to conclude , i would like to reaffirm that we need common agricultural policy for europe .
new strategic importance for food production and cap absolutely .
two pillar absolutely , i agree with that .
food production at heart cap yes , that be absolutely what cap be about .
it need to be objective and transparent as to how money be allocate between member state .
they need to meet challenge europe 2020 strategy .
applause
debate be close .
vote will take place today , thursday 8 july 2010 , at 12.00 .
as mr mcguinness say , they may present they contribution in write .
effort need to be make towards rigor , but it need to be make by all we .
write statement rule 149
adapt cap to new social and economic reality be necessary step .
we actually need to answer some key question to be able to do this .
i totally concur with need to guarantee security food supply .
until now , cap have keep price high for food which be cheaper in other country .
eu can not promote free trade while protect its own agricultural market .
however , i be concerned most about impact which cap reform have have on farmer .
decouple be necessary to avoid overproduction .
we need incentive for farmer , especially to encourage young people to move to rural area .
however , this be not go to happen while maintain current direct payment system , which be ridiculous .
above all , eu need to retain trust european farmer .
europe will still need effective and common agricultural policy after 20thi be why eu poss agricultural budget should at least be maintain at current level .
europe have particular responsibility to guarantee food safety in world .
therefore , main task cap be to preserve agricultural production capacity european union .
it be therefore vital to ensure that direct payment do not decrease .
these would reduce farmersloss arise from price fluctuation .
european food trade be much more concentrated than food processing industry or agricultural production .
this be why we must help improve cooperation between farmer .
however , this require exemption from stringent eu competition rule in agriculture .
i would like to thank all those involve for work they have do .
forward look target have be formulate for entire community .
try and test two pillar structure must be retain with strong first pillar and equally strong second pillar .
major fluctuation in liberalise market and effect climate change continue to necessitate safety net .
we thus provide for possibility transitional period .
such period be essential , but full seven year would be excessively long transitional period .
undistorted competition in europe be also precondition for competitiveness european farmer in world market .
future common agricultural policy after 2013 be extremely important for we .
entire european parliament need to be aware cap poss significance for future eu .
today , difference between level payment in different member state be too great .
this undermine sense solidarity , equality and community .
what farmer need most all be stable income , both now and in longer term .
thank you very much .
report be firm on keep policy eu one , reject attempt to there nationalise it .
to begin with i want to thank my colleague mr lyon for draft very balanced report .
i believe that this have already allow we to create good basis for discussion for near future .
change agricultural policy be perhaps one biggest task this plenary session .
report be good basis for further discussion .
thank you for you attention .
de i thank rapporteur .
we primary goal must be to ensure high quality food production in europe .
in discussion on organization agrarian reform , there be frequent talk compensation public goods .
in my opinion , this debate go in right direction .
development rural area play ever greater role .
however , european union recently gain 12 new member state .
however , this can only be achieve if resource dedicate to agricultural policy be not reduce after 20 i believe that only major reform can save common agricultural policy .
direct payment significantly affect security food supplies .
next item be debate on
i be one author first oral question .
i be not at all happy that we now have joint debate with two question merge .
i have try since may to get mercosur question on agenda .
i do not know how this happen or why this happen .
i be extremely unhappy about it .
can i come back to this in debate ?
i would like clarification please , and i hope other colleague will support i .
clearly there be not enough time this morning .
you see demand and you see problem .
can we get this parliament to work for member parliament , not for administration parliament ?
president cut off speaker
it be not administration that organise debate .
administration help political body organise debate .
mr president , it be not because it be summertime and we be all cross .
it be just because we make very valid point and we take we job seriously .
i be go to take 30 seconds because i have two blank page .
i have ask five question commission .
i do not intend to speak before i hear answer .
i will return at end debate .
thank you very much , mr mcguinness .
i will grant you later time that you have not use now .
by same token , ear tag rule be not enforce .
these be only some example many i could list from fao report last october .
indeed , it will have entirely opposite effect .
we can not accept this .
europe buy 38 million tonne soya and feed for cattle .
these import from brazil and argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectare .
they be concentrate in hand three enterprise cargill , adm and bunch .
between 2001 and 2004 soya destroy more than 1.2 million hectare tropical and equatorial forest .
it be one principal cause increase in greenhouse gas emission and loss biodiversity .
this decision be motivate by need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change .
these effort will be completely undo by this draft bilateral agreement .
these concession will not serve interest farming family mercosur , only those agro industrial group .
many poultry farmer , particularly in brittany , pay price for that deal .
europe seem to want to pursue its policy relocation by intensify its attack against farmer .
we must stop this insane process by offer we citizen quality , locally produce food .
mr president , i will try and be brief .
there be real concern about reopen negotiation with mercosur .
i represent scotland , which have extensive beef production .
secondly , what negotiate mandate will negotiator have in term agricultural product ?
can someone please tell i what they be be allow to negotiate on ?
how many tonne beef ?
how much access ?
be there no tariff , or be there minimum tariff ?
can someone please tell we what mandate be ?
two other point .
two be completely link and therefore we need to understand what impact will be .
finally , what involvement do agriculture commissioner have on this issue ?
will this parliament be consult before any final agreement be reach ?
i would like to hear some answer to these question .
we share common history and social value with they .
deepen political and cultural tie and maximize mutual benefit in economic term therefore make perfect sense .
agriculture be only one part this macro agreement .
fear therefore need to be face in term they proper proportion and justification .
i be thus happy to respond in any format decide by chair .
in economic term , successful agreement could bring considerable benefit to both eu and mercosur .
it be increasingly important partner for eu .
in term foreign direct investment , mercosur be also key partner .
commission have take this decision after thorough examination and in depth internal debate .
this be proper decision college , and parliament be extensively inform immediately afterwards .
that be something quite different .
first meeting with mercosur take place last week in bueno aire .
we will course keep european parliament and council fully inform about evolution negotiation .
this apply to all area to be cover by agreement , include agriculture .
in this context , we be aware that accompany measure might become necessary for most sensitive sector .
it be , however , way too early to discuss what these measure could cover .
we be only just start negotiation and have not yet enter into discussion on substance .
it be not trade commissioner who decide what agricultural offer will be put on table .
be fully include in these discussion . so mr dacian ciolo ?
i believe that if we make right choice it be possible to successfully conclude both negotiation .
as regard food safety , it go without say that import have to fully respect eu food safety requirement .
eu approach in all trade negotiation be certainly not to decrease eu level protection .
now let i turn to eu brazil summit and start with short overview we relation .
moreover , brazil often act as informal bridge between western and emerge and develop country .
brazil be one nine country with which eu have enter into strategic partnership .
moment for such assessment be particularly appropriate as president lulum poss term in office approach its end .
at summit we will confirm we commitment to strengn non proliferation and encourage closer cooperation .
brazil oppose iran sanction adopt last june by un security council .
summit will also address regional issue cuba , hondura , paraguay and venezuelum .
lastly , tough work be still be finalize on some issue where we expect summit to deliver .
first , signature horizontal civil aviation agreement and air safety agreement .
second , announcement joint work program on triangular cooperation with develop country .
i will try to give additional example in response to you question .
brief digression commissioner , negotiation with country ande and central america have be complete .
do agreement include net exporter clause , in order to prevent development trade triangle ?
can commission assure we that import price will be maintain in fruit and vegetable sector ?
brazil be only bric country with which europe have no strategic partnership .
beef import will increase by 70 % , poultry import by 25 % .
commissioner , i would therefore like to voice my concern to you .
we agriculture be in great difficulty .
destabilise it further will have serious consequence .
we can not develop european trade policy without take account and defend one we main asset .
commission must hear this message and this demand .
my group and i share these concern .
that be why impact assessment be absolutely essential .
clearly there be lack consistency here .
nor must we lose sight misgiving agricultural sector in relation to cheap meat import .
e mr president , we be all pleased about free political prisoner in cuba .
with regard to subject mercosur , there be several clarification that need to be make .
i do not understand why certain sector or interest group should come out this negotiation at disadvantage .
it will depend on firmness we negotiator .
disastrous knock on effect might also follow for other sector , such as pork sector for example .
commissioner , i would ask you to be particularly vigilant in this regard .
this be not scaremonger .
european farmer be operate under strict health and safety criterion .
they adhere to all standard set for they and they guarantee high quality , safe produce for consumer .
i agree that we must improve coordination all these topic within european parliament .
i should like to emphasise one point in particular .
i be actually grateful that commission have reopen negotiation .
on 5 may this year , this house support reopen negotiation in salafranca report .
in other word , commission be do exactly what parliament decide by large majority .
noneless , i would argue that we do not want agreement at any price .
naturally interest agriculture , industry and service sector must be take into account as whole .
however , commissioner , this trade with mercosur country should not be allow to become one way street .
frequent claim make in public that europe be close itself off in agricultural market be quite wrong .
we purchase over 90 % african agricultural export and 45 % central and south american agricultural export .
europe be certainly not close off to external trade .
what i would criticise , commissioner , be information policy pursue .
it have not be good .
as agricultural policymaker , i first learn that these negotiation have begin when i open newspaper .
in future we should not have to rely on press for we information .
i urge you to inform agricultural sector represent here in parliament about progress negotiation .
last year , parliament pass most stringent plant protection product legislation in world .
many active ingredient be prohibit in europe .
consumer protection be inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiation .
you be not tell truth !
this be truth , mr de gucht .
this be other reason for my question .
incidentally , i would add that new member state can only lose out here .
they should sort it out themselves .
there be no need to provide eu framework for this .
hu european commission define negotiate mandate some 11 year ago .
world have change over past 11 year .
european commission have disregard these development .
it have not request new mandate .
without proper mandate , we can only reach unacceptable agreement .
go back to draw board .
last speaker address some point that i would wish to make .
contrast that to delight , or rather to fear and trepidation and anger , among eu producer .
this parliament impose high standard food production on we producer .
we have fail to defend they in past .
there be no consistency between agriculture and trade policy .
this parliament have to insist that there will be .
that be precisely issue be discuss behind scene at negotiation with mercosur .
where , i ask , be consistency ?
already we be talk about possible concession on agriculture , and i would like you to clarify this .
in you response you speak about forthcoming summit on climate change .
i come from ireland , and we export 90 % we beef .
recent research have show that brazilian emission be between three and eight time higher than irish equivalent .
will any this be take into consideration in you impact assessment ?
it mr president , lady and gentleman , spanish presidency have decide to sign this agreement .
i therefore call on commission to adopt authoritative position so as to safeguard european quality production .
sacrifice agriculture for gain in other area be simply unacceptable .
beef industry in unite kingdom be currently experience fall in farm gate price .
how be europe go to provide for these people ?
commission that claim to act in best interest citizen must do so .
we must end these talk and look after we farmer .
pl negotiation with mercosur country be suspend in 200however , we should also be protect interest we farmer and agriculture and food sector .
if that happen , it would be necessary to propose certain form compensation to farmer .
expert estimate that make such agreement could result in very large loss income among farmer .
these will be even higher if agreement be both bilateral and make at wto level .
however , when i consider we agricultural production and product themselves , not everything can be prove scientifically .
in europe we have some excellent legislation in relation to future biodiversity .
politician must be able to decide , even when scientific evidence be unavailable .
we do not want clone meat from mercosur country .
you understand that we feel that mandate be no longer valid .
i would also like to draw you attention to political aspect mercosur .
in trade , key element be confidence .
mercosur be almost dissolve at 2007 summit .
country do not agree on accession .
venezuelum almost do not accede .
how can we negotiate in such politically unstable area ?
first check political stability mercosur and then we will conclude trade agreement .
de mr president , i believe that we have talk great deal about sustainability .
i think this be outrage .
please tell we when you be go to ignore people .
colleague , by way explanation , i have about 18 people on list .
today i take eight speaker .
so i think i have do maximum i could have do .
first all on mandate .
several member criticise fact that we be work on basis mandate go back to 199thi apply to all area to be cover by agreement , include agriculture .
that be still true .
that be still what we have to do , so nothing much have to be add to this mandate .
in mean time , we have problem climate change and world have change since then .
yes , we have notice that too , and we will take this into consideration in negotiation .
that be not reason to change mandate .
there be another member who say that council should be here and that council should instruct we .
council do not have to instruct we .
we be not instruct by council .
we will stick to that .
i be ready to discuss at length any element .
i have do so with inta committee and i be ready to go back to inta committee .
letter be send by director general for trade to he argentinean counterpart on 12 may .
we message be very strong and very clear .
we will insist that we have this meeting as soon as possible .
on sugar
similar quota be provide for within framework negotiation with central america .
colombian , peruvian and central american aggregated quantity account for less than 2 % european consumption .
as for plant health , environmental and other measure .
but those be not one that we can impose on other country .
i presume that this be not last time we will discuss mercosur in this plenary .
commissioner , i be also sure that this will not be last time we do so .
joint debate be close .
reopen negotiation with mercosur country without consult member state be very dirty play .
otherwise , cost concession under wto will be bear by we farmer .
these mercosor talk represent potentially dreadful development for future european agriculture .
i have to say that commission poss attitude to matter have be appalling .
this attitude , i find , be appalling .
it be hearten to see so many agricultural mep here from all group support protection agriculture .
it seem that mercosur negotiation be only pursue one goal to hand over defenceless european agriculture .
sensitive agricultural sector must not be hand over in negotiation .
feel free to sell you grandmor , commissioner , but do not give away we european agriculture .
two commissioner for one report , what honor !
import fishery and aquaculture product from third country account for more than 60 % eu consumption .
lady and gentleman , survival european fishery be non negotiable .
in essence , we be demand follow .
this will mean that better account be take specific characteristic fishery and aquaculture product .
i think this be perfect time to review term this fundamental debate .
indeed , we be on eve important reform cfp .
we have fishery sector that be neither ecologically sustainable nor economically perform well .
so here we need answer .
i strongly support you call for increase coherence we policy .
we need to work together with global and integrate vision .
with reference to wto negotiation , we be pay particular attention to ongoing discussion on subsidy .
this bring we to label .
consumer want to know more about seafood they buy .
commission be ready to work on legislative initiative aim at give consumer information they need .
finally , word on aquaculture .
this sensitivity be take into consideration in implementation common commercial policy .
i will be very honest with you on this point .
we therefore actively defend much stronger integration social and environmental criterion into trade agreement regard fishery product .
however , we must be clear .
for these reason my group will obviously vote in favor report .
moreover , i would like to congratulate mr cadec on excellent work that he have do .
they enter european market at price that be uneconomic for european producer .
europe poss own catch have diminish at alarming rate by 26 % since 1997 alone .
this should not need to be case .
cadec report mention several important instrument that eu can use .
first be iuu regulation .
that be first step , but it do not go far enough .
second instrument be already in place in unite nation .
we have good international agreement , but we also need to implement they .
we must continue to pursue this .
mr president , commissioner , first all i want to thank rapporteur for he report .
value nethrop or langoustine sell by my fisherman in norrn ireland to other part europe plummet .
this at same time as import shellfish and fish have become increasingly available .
europe need fish .
we need fish import , but i would contend that these should not come at any cost .
on one hand , my colleague want to stop we fisherman receive any subsidy .
europe can not have it both way .
be it you responsibility to prevent this ?
it would not happen in any other parliament in world .
applause
mr gallagher , we have to carry on .
de mr president , mr damanak i , european fishery policy be face enormous challenge .
do both these thing at same time will place too high burden on we fisherman .
best way to increase competitiveness be to allow fish stock to recover .
another way to enable european fishery to survive would be through better marketing .
i would also like to thank he for he excellent cooperation .
there be major challenge involve in regulate import fishery and aquaculture product into eu .
this market be grow rapidly and be increasingly dependent on import from third country .
we have now submit two amendment in plenary .
these relate to need for we to recognize special economic situation in peripheral region europe .
however , we do not hold market liberalisation alone responsible for difficulty .
president cut off speaker
without be protectionist , line defend here may be describe as less na?ve .
that be why i favor european label , in accordance with we standard , both environmental and social .
we be tell originally that there would be vote at 12.00 .
this have move by five minute every five minute .
people have plane to catch it be inconvenient it make mockery parliament .
someone get grip !
applause
i would like to say that we be take care all concern mention by member .
as mr de gucht and i have already mention , we be try to find balance .
we need viable fishery sector and we have some obligation to wto and other international body .
what you be do here be scandalous .
you make i feel ashamed .
all you be worry about be vote and go home .
i will finish my speech by thank you in advance for you vote .
debate be close .

oral explanation vote
pl i endorse alvaro report .
in order to be effective , we must have workable instrument for fight terrorism .
one very important preventative tool involve monitoring and reduce financial resource which reach and belong to terrorist .
very often , in fact , money be fuel for terrorist activity .
f i mr president , i vote in favor this report by mr alvaro .
in this respect it need to be very clear .
mr president , there be always delicate balance to be draw between civil liberty and security .
several time since twin tower attack nine year ago i think we have get that balance wrong .
this chamber have make that mistake , but it have not be alone .
national parliament have do same thing on both side atlantic .
on this occasion , though , i believe we have get balance right .
ga mr president , i vote against report on european external action service .
mr president , i support elmar brok poss report .
unite position european parliament have take maximum advantage new opportunity lisbon treaty offer .
i support especially european parliament poss political and financial supervision european external action service .
this process have only begin .
mr president , i vote against this report .
those we who oppose creation eeas out principle in 2008 still oppose it .
otherwise , i vote in line with my group poss position on matter .
lv thank you , mr president .
european external action service will represent common position whole european union .
this practice must become priority european union foreign policy .
adequate geographical representation must be unambiguous fundamental principle in formation service .
thank you .
i want to draw attention to some important problem which we should take into account .
secondly , eu diplomatic service should reflect character union .
responsibility for important regulatory , supervisory and budgetary function rest with european parliament .
thirdly , unclear situation concern who have control eeas be cause great concern .
this may lead to establishment another union institution .
eeas should build on value and identity european union .
president cut off speaker
despite that , i do have few question and concern regard this new service .
obviously , high representative need resource .
in this way we could ensure that service operate in more equitable fashion .
human rights have to be she top concern .
european union poss diplomatic corps have already squeeze out national service .
what be it do ?
i think we could just about manage to do better .
we be fourth largest military power on planet and fifth largest economy .
i think we can run we own foreign policy to suit we own interest !
de mr president , i vote against brok report for four reason .
architecture service have numerous weakness , detail which still cause we great concern .
that expose these fund to numerous risk , and safeguard against these risk be still extremely unclear .
third point be relinquishment rights this parliament in council regulation .
fourth point be question how we actually treat each other in parliament .
unfortunately , i do not have any option other than to vote against this text .
however , i be from country which have not recognize kosovo poss independence .
i regret that position state which do not recognize kosovo poss independence be not give greater consideration .
mr president , i vote in favor resolution .
kosovo can be consider last piece in complex balkan political puzzle .
independence kosovo have already be recognize by 69 country , include 22 eu member state .
that be crucial point .
most member state have now do this .
i be early supporter kosovan independence .
there be conflict between supranationalism and democracy .
we should recognize it .
 albania be certainly country which have make tangible progress in context reform process .
political crisis follow june 2009 parliamentary election be deplorable .
de mr president , ex communist socialist in albania be try to destabilise successful government there .
this be not case , and i also say this to mr f?le yesterday .
eu commissioner must not be abuse for purpose socialist propaganda and for internal political end .
macedonian government have democratic legitimacy .
it do first class work and it be put country on path towards european union membership .
aid to kyrgyzstan should be target at people and not at specific government .
uzbekistan have different opinion in this question .
as report indicate , several human rights activist have be arrest without due cause in kyrgyzstan .
these fact must be bear in mind when evaluate european union strategy towards exist political power in kyrgyzstan .
those country also have significant influence in this region .
that be why i support this report , since this investigation be desperately necessary .
thank you .
it state that in 2008 alone , 2.7 million more people be infect .
eu have invest billion euro and number people infect be increase .
have it already be 30 year ?
policy sexual and reproductive rights will not help africa .
de mr president , common agricultural policy be success story .
course , there be new and future task .
these include green growth , renewable energy and combate world hunger .
we must now work together to provide suitable financial resource for these political task .
europe have duty to guarantee food security for its citizen .
europe must guarantee suitable livelihood for rural community .
we must produce and maintain healthy environment here .
we farmer need fair wage .
pl i endorse this report .
this be not inconsistent with free market principle .
number young farmer continue to fall , while we have increase number older farmer .
farmer have hold protest about this .
in summary , we should aim for sustainable development agriculture and rural area .
lv thank you , mr president .
it stress that finance for policy must be preserve for at least next long term financial period .
secondly , it require that direct payment to farmer be fully finance from european union budget .
these destructive discrepancy distort competition and whole european union market .
f i mr president , i have to say that i vote in favor lyon report .
on few point i have what i might call national reservation , or i vote bit differently .
that be why i introduce few derogation when i vote .
every member state need its own agriculture and have to ensure that it be preserve .
mr president , i vote against lyon report because all over europe government be cut they budget .
in unite kingdom nurse and teacher face cut in they pay and pension .
police number be be cut and prisoner be be release because we can not afford to keep they in prison .
i find that entirely unacceptable .
government in uk and government across europe be say we be all in this together .
if we be in it together , we all have to feel pain together .
scrap cap would allow efficient farmer to thrive .
reform be not enough it be time to scrap cap .
they be need to guarantee food supply as well as sustainable development .
first one be environmental , social and qualitative nature .
second aspect be economic one .
lv thank you .
for this reason , i support this report , which call for current situation to be change .
and finally , we must do much more to promote aquaculture .
that would greatly help to solve this problem .
mr president , i would like to thank you and all you staff for all you patience .
surely it be time to learn from lesson successful fish preservation and conservation .
write explanation vote
noterror agreementrespect grassroot freedom .
today , term this agreement have be considerably improve , in interest european citizen .
agreement be significant step forward compare to previous version .
give highly sensitive nature personal datum transfer , i could not vote for this agreement .
agreement state that europe will develop its own system for collection and sort bank detail .
that will offer opportunity to individualise transfer .
from that moment on , issue reciprocity will become relevant .
europol will be charge with task verify and approve we request .
new agreement strike balance between protect privacy and guarantee security .
in meantime , fight against terrorism will remain we override concern .
while this agreement be satisfactory , certain point could still have be improve .
confidential and private financial datum belong to individual and not to eu or european parliament .
this be matter for national government to decide , and not for european parliament .
this new agreement be better than previous one .
this agreement , however , continue to allow mass transfer datum bulk datum .
choice europol be wrong .
europol be neither judicial authority nor datum protection authority .
pt fight against terrorism must be priority for european union .
i be therefore vote in favor measure propose in this report .
thanks to action mp and we group in particular , new version be draw up .
it contain significant underlie improvement , such as elimination ofbulkda transfer .
that be why i choose to vote in favor new agreement .
few month ago first version agreement be too vague and do not offer similar guarantee .
that be why we saidno .
commission should carry out this task in assiduous and timely fashion .
article 15 and 16 ensure that citizen have strengn access to redress and increase transparency .
new version be improvement on last one .
it be unfortunate that majority in parliament have now vote in favor this agreement .
we rather support more secure society with broad democratic rights and freedom .
combate terrorism must not become excuse for inadequate datum protection .
these be serious infringement fundamental rights .
however , european union be not permit to unduly curtail exist fundamental rights .
i therefore still reject this swift agreement .
today , after careful consideration , i vote in favor revise swift agreement .
this new version also bring improvement , in particular as regard purpose datum transfer .
in view importance datum protection , spd delegation do not make its decision lightly .
for we , top priority be limit transfer bulk datum .
sepa datum be not cover by agreement most transfer be not affect at all .
new agreement be victory for all european institution , and for we european parliament in particular .
i vote against this report .
it be tantamount to approval unite state interference in europe with complicity body such as swift .
this report and agreement that it ratify be symbol this europe poss enslavement by american imperialism .
all mechanism that help to discover possible attack be fundamental to this fight poss success .
project for solution approve today be good start point for difficult negotiation ahead with we .
de datum protection with swift agreement be simply sham .
i vote in favor alvaro report because i consider it important to combat terrorism .
terrorism be threat and as such must be combate .
there hash swift agreement do very little to change this situation .
citizen would first have to cope with cost institute legal proceedings in unite state !
what be first celebrate as success for european parliament in february have now become washout .
even rapporteur admit that he be not totally satisfied .
it do not provide any real , effective datum protection and should therefore be reject .
agreement also mark new phase in parliament poss power , ensure european democratic oversight international agreement .
this commitment will in mid term ensure termination bulk datum transfer to we authority .
i vote in favor new swift agreement at today poss plenary european parliament .
this be very important agreement which aim to stamp out terrorism and organise crime by combate illegal financing .
it be important that this new agreement also safeguard respect for personal datum european citizen .
new agreement refer to need to create european tftp terrorist finance tracking program .
this be commitment which need to be implement within five year .
this be not case here .
present agreement enable transfer banking datum , but introduce proper security and privacy safeguard .
real change towards binding fundamental rights protection in fight against terrorism require greater courage and effort .
terrorist act must be prevent and every terrorist act must be condemn in strongest possible term .
on other hand , there be protection citizensright .
citizensright be not foregone conclusion we have fight for they .
it be tool nato strategy and war .
it will be tool for apply precedence community law over national law state .
this compromise be subject extensive negotiation and it currently seem satisfactory and balanced to i .
it allow european parliament to reinforce its prerogative and preserve community method .
in addition , latter poss budget will be subject to political control from parliament .
my country have show its commitment to european crisis management mission .
european external action service eeas represent considerable progress in this respect .
european interest initial draft have be retain .
i be confident that subsequent negotiation on establishment eeas will respect this balance .
will member state no longer be free to define they own foreign policy ?
it be not acceptable to sovereign nation for european organization to scrutinise its foreign service .
it be not business ep to do so .
common foreign policy and common economic policy be necessary objective european integration process .
i welcome brok report as amend .
it be essential to resist proposal to subsume development policy as part we foreign policy .
we need autonomous development service answerable to autonomous commissioner for development and humanitarian aid .
we need ensure implementation be pursue in accordance with spirit and letter agreement .
there remain element proposal that could give rise to different interpretation .
rule and practice govern language in this service will reveal extent its commitment to external communication .
same thing have happen with regard to eu intelligence structure .
we , as member european parliament strengn by treaty , can help with this .
what have parliament manage to win in negotiation with high representative ?
furthermore , it will have effect strengn european parliament poss political and budgetary control power .
i sincerely hope that best use will be make this service in interest european union .
latter will thus demonstrate genuine political coherence and will speak with one voice on international stage .
it can only emerge greater from this , and its action will be more legitimate and effective .
proposal make by baroness ashton be unacceptable .
i shall vote against this text .
today poss vote lay foundation for strong diplomatic service at european union level .
moreover , at least 60 % staff this new service will be eu official .
this report will ensure geographical balance as well as better coherence between different aspect eeas .
it be not about duplicate diplomatic service within eu , but about strengn eu poss diplomatic service .
this be chance for european union but also for its member state .
timely coordination different area eu external policy by commission be clearly important .
this include , in particular , footnote that be adopt in text today .
better service could have be possible , though .
we support compromise because parliament manage to improve m ashton poss original proposal considerably .
deal be not flawless , however .
they must work together , create common esprit de corps and overcome divisive competition .
in any case , these cost should be within sensible and comprehensible limit .
in this regard , we must utilise synergy in order to achieve maximum quality and cost savings .
kosovo be part very sensitive geographical zone , on which eu should maintain constant focus .
it be without hesitation that i support this resolution , which address these important issue .
resolution also call for even stronger presence eulex in kosovo .
pt i vote against this resolution .
pt kosovo have still not receive unanimous recognition by member state .
kosovo still have long way to go .
for these reason , i can not support mr lunacek poss motion for resolution .
it have therefore have no real impact on situation in country so far .
rampant , widespread corruption and smuggling weapon and drug sow unrest in region .
it be strange that currency in this territory be euro .
particularly as basic precondition for use common european currency have not even superficially be meet .
this attack take place four day after explosion in mitrovica during serb demonstration .
eu basically need to deal with process establish democracy and reinforce stability in kosovo .
five eu member state , include france , have not recognize kosovo poss independence .
consequently , it be unacceptable to present report today that advocate integration kosovo into eu .
i shall vote against this unacceptable and provocative text .
this be signal encouragement for government as well as citizen kosovo .
with this resolution , parliament be in favor start talk on visa liberalisation as soon as possible .
that be why it will need all we support .
union should continue its strategy expansion in gradual and strict manner .
neverless , everyone know that road to join union be demand one .
condition govern entry to eu be clear and well know , and not always easy to fulfil .
i hope that albania proceeds along its way towards union in determine and unhesitating manner .
it be out friendship for  albanian that i vote against this text .
i vote against this text .
it encourage development and use renewable energy , public transport and environmental legislation .
this matter be entirely up to  albanian people themselves .
one these measure be to promote people to people contact through academic exchange between pupil , student and scientist .
we should , in principle , support visa exemption for country western balkan .
however , prerequisite for this be that all condition lay down be fully meet .
i vote in favor joint motion for resolution draft by various political group .
instrument should therefore be introduce to help there establish security in kyrgyzstan .
we must not let ourselves be deceive .
abortion in world be real tragedy , but it be real tragedy in we europe too !
neverless , i do not agree with associate fight against hiv with sensitive issue like abortion .
resolution also require government to fulfil they obligation to make public health service available to all citizen .
in order to stop disease , much research be be carry out , also within eu .
since research in area hiv aid be essential , i vote for resolution .
as advocate right to life , i could not in good conscience vote in favor .
neverless , i would reiterate my total commitment to fight against hiv aid .
it also show that ppe group be divide on issue .
it be not problem , today , drug addict or homosexual , but everyone .
almost half those live with hiv be woman .
woman must have universal and easy access to information on health aspect sex , reproduction and medical service .
school education program on sexual and reproductive rights be crucial for hiv aid prevention .
for these reason ecr group have decide to abstain on this resolution .
this convention need to be apply immediately by all state .
parliament poss support for they prohibition and eradication be fully justified .
regrettably , child be main victim this type explosive material .
we motion for resolution be balance .
farmer also provide food , which we need in order to live .
report consider painful consequence for small and medium size farm to be success .
they generate more than eur 337 billion in production annually at eu level .
several amendment have be table in plenary part session .
lt i vote for this report .
new cap will have to adapt to change european and global context and withstand many challenge .
european agriculture must ensure food security to its own consumer and contribute to feed steadily grow world population .
agriculture be important to we citizen .
however , firm policy will need to be back up by sufficient financial means .
there be challenge that we have already mention and there will be new one to contend with .
union now consist great number member state .
i endorse this report because it call for comparable fund to be appropriate for agriculture in post 2013 budget .
that say , some reformulation will be necessary .
first all , we need simplify arrangement and less red tape .
transition period where we proceed with caution will be major importance in this respect .
this report give agricultural policy strategic role in term food security and sustainable development .
report also deal with link between agricultural policy and fight climate change .
this be not include in report .
this be not include in report .
this be not include in report either .
amendment 3 we danish social democrat believe that eu subsidy should be remove from european agricultural policy .
free and fair trade should be guide principle for agricultural area base on sustainability .
this be issue that concern european , naturally , but also citizen world .
that be why this reform should not be business expert , but rather farmer and consumer .
we have to rethink general objective new common agricultural policy .
european have new expectation in term food production and supply .
we must maintain pillar 1 payment , reward farmer for work , secure industry with direct payment .
we must define what we mean by fair distribution cap and look at production cost .
regional variation be vital .
we must maintain market control measure which control price volatility and ensure profitability .
it have my vote and that group alliance liberal and democrat for europe .
most important thing be that it acknowledge injustice do to farmer new member state .
it draw attention to food security and supply high quality product at reasonable price .
in truth , we can not understand what benefit possible transfer cap fund to other policy could bring .
instead , we be advocate measure to secure only truly common policy that exist in eu .
i would also advocate market regulation in dairy sector , from production to marketing .
this be thrust one various amendment that we have table to report under discussion .
this route be also note in report .
we consider such view unacceptable .
in addition to food production , agriculture also make significant contribution to preserve cultural landscape .
reality be quite different .
i also believe that it be essential to consider regionsterritorial feature and priority .
we must promote common norm and objective , take into account specific nature each region .
this will enable we to achieve dynamic , multifunctional and sustainable agriculture in europe .
i be delighted that my amendment along these line have find they place in this text .
it be also advisable to retain specific tool to manage production potential that some sector have .
biodiversity support measure must not be forget .
2009 crisis show weakness system measure to support agriculture .
it be important to guarantee reasonable consumer price and fair income for farmer by use target aid .
market support measure be recognize as be important part cap .
we have reject any attempt to renationalise policy .
commission must come forward with idea in this regard but caution be require .
this text have merit recognize market failure and advocate fight against climate change .
there its merit end .
on contrary it support productivism and devastation local crop farming here and throughout world .
in truth , we can not understand what benefit possible transfer cap fund to other policy could bring .
instead , we be advocate measure to secure only truly common policy that exist in eu .
decouple assistance favor large landowner , and threaten small operation and family run farm .
despite failure lisbon strategy , eu have not change its economic policy .
it be not commit to food security , but to competitiveness , which only favor large multinational .
i believe that agricultural sector need to be consider as strategic within european union .
i support structure and approach lyon report .
thus , adoption this report be highly satisfactory .
yet again european parliament have abdicate its responsibility by fail to reform cap .
i believe this report should be rename increase in subsidy to inefficient farmersreport .
it penalize efficient farmer and prop up inefficient one .
that be what cap reform should be about .
what consumer care about be quality and price .
this apply not only to car and television , but also to bread , vegetable , meat and milk .
however , function market and competitive environment would solve this problem in natural way .
now , like rapporteur , it seem critical to i to restore we communal production .
import fishery and aquaculture product have increase enormously , but that increase have be necessary .
in my opinion , environmental and social circumstance must also be take into account .
import be necessary .
i be not in favor protectionism by stealth , but we do need to prevent unfair competition .
for that reason , i will be vote in favor this own initiative report .
i vote in favor report by mr cadec .
import product must satisfy same quality criterion as those produce in eu .
report call for creation ecolabel for fishery product .
at same time , develop country need to be able to develop they own fishing .
accord to report , europe currently import 60 % fish it consume .
have grow rapidly since 2005 , this market be increasingly dependent on import .
i fully support need to change and revitalise eu poss fishery and aquaculture sector .
european fishery can not survive in long term with protectionism and subsidy .
it be time to make up for underestimate and delay past .
fishing be key sector in we economic and social system and as such it must be respect .
in addition , greater attention should be pay to food security aspect in order to safeguard consumer .
money save as result could be make available to program conduct by producersorganisation .
quality import fishery product be extremely important in this context .
i therefore advocate stringent policy certification , which could control these problem effectively .
de for its survival , every state need to maintain food self sufficiency .
fishing be important for food , and also ensure variety job .
with import , however , adherence to we own rule can hardly be monitor .
measure propose be step in right direction , and i have vote for report .
community strategy for sustainable development aquaculture be recently approve .
i agree with rapporteur on issue custom protection .
for these reason , i vote in favor this report .
when there be lack knowledge among consumer , only argument in market become price .
therefore , it be necessary to tighten up legislation on identification .
thank you .

zimbabwe , in particular case fara i maguwu
unfortunately , once again we be force to address they .
this time it be case human rights activist fara i maguwu .
he be simply prisoner conscience .
this be clearly unacceptable .
secondly , we be deal with strange role that monitor kimberley process have play .
ultimately , then , we be also deal with kimberley process itself .
it have prove to be successful system .
they be not cover by this resolution and that be why we be demand amendment .
after all , all diamond be mine in appalling condition .
to say that situation in zimbabwe be tragic be unfortunately understatement .
last election take place in climate fear .
time and again these condition have be condemn by ngo , include that mr maguwu .
intersessional meeting in tel aviv fail to reach decision on follow up to this report .
european union be main contributor humanitarian aid to zimbabwe .
it must maintain its position .
can you tell we what position european union will be in st petersburg ?
i have to say this be one area where this house speak with one voice .
today we be discuss systematic abuse worker in diamond field zimbabwe by government security force .
if i stand up and speak as englishman , they will dismiss it .
as european , they will dismiss we .
we talk about africa be in you hand , and future africa be in you hand .
on issue protection human rights , this be question we fundamental credibility .
here , we must say clearlyyea , yea nay , nay .
human rights be be uphold or they be not .
we must not content ourselves with small advance .
i have impression that in some speech there be element satisfaction with small advance .
keyword in this case be transparency .
exploitation diamond have role to play in combate poverty and achieve millennium development goal .
today , however , we be talk about someone for whom diamond may become curse .
fara i maguwu be arrest on charge publish information prejudicial to state .
we know constructive example use diamond for development right kind .
botswana be one such case .
during last 30 year mugabe regime have make zimbabwe bankrupt and turn it into humanitarian disaster .
blood diamond be proof cynicism display by govern circle lack scruple and respect for they own citizen .
zimbabwe be violate standard stipulate by kimberley process certification scheme for sell rough diamond .
madam president , it be now less than five week since fara i maguwu be detain by zimbabwean authority .
i also agree that african state have important role to play in improve condition there .
inevitably wealth from these mine be now bankroll mugabe poss henchman .
zimbabwe should therefore be refuse readmission to kimberley process .
in addition , we condemn illegal arrest which be be make and demand release fara i maguwu .
eu delegation be monitor he situation very closely .
this be issue we have raise on various occasion and in different forum .
debate be close .
vote will take place shortly .
write statement rule 149
i join voice call for release fara i maguwu .
he be arrest for provide information on kimberley process .
fara i maguwu must be release from prison immediately .
venezuelum , in particular case marium lourde afiuni
this lead to she incarceration in maximum security prison , in condition that be put she life in danger .
amnesty international and unite nation high commissioner for human rights have indicate they great concern .
this be not isolate case , lady and gentleman .
we have therefore request that judge afiun i be free immediately .
thing have not improve since we last resolution quite opposite .
several judge have become victim such presidential behavior .
some have be remove from office or have leave country .
there be no doubt this measure be take to humiliate she and to frighten she .
vez , judge afiun i must be free immediately .
this would not only be fair on you part , but also notable humanitarian gesture .
question certainly deserve to be ask , as both combination be common in hardline regime .
what be issue at stake here ?
she be arrest follow this release and place in detention .
it be true that she detention condition be absolutely terrible , like those in all venezuelan prison .
however , we be not hold urgent debate on prison here .
i agree with you on that , but i can not agree with you on rest .
e madam president , i be same opinion as mr de keyser .
perhaps not in form emergency resolution .
it will have escape nobody poss attention that we have election very soon .
vez complete lack . lack affinity or political sympathy for mr ch ?
he have now target independence judiciary as next obstacle to he assumption absolute power .
how this judge can hope for fair trial be beyond i .
this paradox continue to undermine eu poss collective effort to expose alarming trend towards totalitarianism in venezuelum .
applause
vez pose danger to democracy and rule law ?
mr posselt , it be question priority .
what i be say specifically be that we should keep clear what be important and what priority be .
that be why we have this campaign vilification .
i be also fill with sadness by attitude mr de keyser and mr romeva i rueda .
hopefully , nobody here would argue otherwise .
venezuelum want to make civil society participation subject to domestic law .
there be bad precedent .
legitimacy next parliament be crucial in these time deteriorate democracy .
vez be govern in venezuelum . way president ch ?
during my previous speech i refer to journalist .
venezuelum have be land refuge for many .
madam president , eu be closely follow situation in venezuelum .
we be follow tendency political polarisation there emerge in country with concern .
applause
vote will take place shortly .
write statement rule 149
case marium lourde afiun i be absolutely appalling to anyone who defend democratic value .
it highlight fact that rule law be nothing but meaningless concept in venezuelum .
vez come to power . have increase since hugo ch ?
judicial authority do not usually dare speak out against government .
when this do happen , consequence be drastic .
venezuelan government must release judge afiun i quickly and stop its attack on independence judiciary .
north korea
next item be debate on seven motion for resolution on north korea .
it be also measure how serious situation be in kim jong il poss famished empire .
we do not have name any dissident or activist in territory north korea .
that information must be allow to percolate through to we .
situation there be even incomparable with that in former soviet union or ceausescu poss romania .
various concrete recommendation to this effect may be find in parliament poss joint resolution .
well do !
i also wholeheartedly support paragraph 14 resolution .
madam president , officially north korea claim that it guarantee religious freedom to its population 24 million .
what evidence be there he crime 20 bible and 10 worship tape ?
it would appear that this be thing that north korean authority literally mortally fear .
i would like to focus on two thing .
there be second point i would like to mention .
it be ridiculously difficult to get out this country , to escape .
that be important when we consider situation that these people be in .
what be currently happen here be appalling .
applause
recently we have be able to see sportsman from north korea play at fifa world cup .
in follow match they do not do so well .
why be i talk about this sport event ?
afterwards , player meet with repression , and they be hold in force labor camp .
we be very worried about what be go to happen to these sportsman next .
this be perhaps country like no other in world right now .
this should be one future topic we discussion with china when we have we bilateral dialogue .
reportedly 80 % north korean in china end up as trafficking victim .
woman be particularly vulnerable to prostitution , rape , arrange marriage and bride trafficker .
china must change its law to protect victim trafficking instead return they to north korea .
therefore i will not expand on what other colleague have say .
question really be , what can we do about it ?
there be 24 million people in north korea who need we assistance .
provision radio in country where there be no information be actually vital tool .
finally , we should do we best to assist refugee .
as other colleague have say , people flee north korea and they be not give assistance they deserve .
unfortunately , thing be not as mr vigenin and mr martin have say .
this be unfortunate , because it would seem that on this question we ought to be unite .
i come from country which be rule by communism .
this be something which we should guarantee .
however , there have also be experience footballer be make personally responsible for defeat .
i call on north korean government to explain whereabouts footballer .
even potential victory in football can not mask reality situation .
occasional news leak come out from defector and reality be truly horrific .
death penalty be apply regularly with no regard to rule law .
we all remain extremely concern about north korea .
regrettably pyongyang have nuclear weapon and seek collaboration with other nefarious regime around world , such as iran .
also recent sink south korean naval vessel be undoubtedly deliberate attack by north .
government people poss republic korea deny existence problem human rights violation .
this be , however , at complete variance with eye witness report refugee and defector .
pl madam president , north korea and cuba be last remnant communism in world .
dream many north korean be simply to flee they own country .
however , life be better there than in north korea .
ro human rights situation in north korea be give particularly grave cause for concern .
leadership in this country ban any form political opposition , democratic election , press and religious freedom .
accord to report , more than 150 000 north korean continue to be hold in six labor camp .
they be not give any kind medical care and receive very little food .
torture and sentence in force labor camp , often because political view , be everyday occurrence there .
how can we help korean in this situation ?
through active joint approach by great power .
ro there be so many human rights violation in north korea that we can not list they all .
majority those send to these camp be no longer release .
if they have child , latter can spend they whole life in captivity .
although perhaps unwillingly , west have rather often turn its attention away from event on korean peninsula .
therefore , we must talk specifically about crime which be be commit and renew we appeal .
madam president , i would like to congratulate parliament for undertake this debate .
we will continue to do so .
these people can not simply be regard aseconomic migrant .
we very much welcome convergence view among member and between member parliament and commission .
we should not punish they for sin they leader .
negotiate text for this free trade agreement provide for possibility designate outward processing zone .
she be , however , now consider all option to do it in context two thing .
third point be proposal to press for establishment commission inquiry at un .
with this in mind , we need to ensure that he have all back up to do he job .
from commission poss position , we see this today as better course in front we .

baltic nuclear triangle be create be not just concern for lithuanium but whole europe ...

implementation strategy have be slow so far ...
we need to lower start process and step up we effort ...
i congratulate rapporteur on very well draft report ...

russia , belarus and norway should be involve in this co-operation ...
interdisciplinary co-operation be need here , includes in european parliament committee ...
this macro region strategy for baltic sea be pilot project ...

nowadays , all actor in we region be affect by crises ...

we sme , which make up 99 % europe poss productive tissue , need freedom from bureaucracy ...

positive response to combate finance and economic crises have demonstrate importance eu region political ...
i fully welcome this report ...
i abstain from voting on report ...
however , i have my doubt about fixation on competitiveness that pervade document ...
this be to be do within region political budgetary framework ...
no proper impact assessment have be carry out in this regard ...
they currently overlap one other , result in lack clarity ...
it be important that these instrument be not solely use as fire fight interference ...
implementation cohesion political program should be speed up in order to help these region at this time ...
however , it seem preferred to i to abstain on amendments all this have to do with voting at second reading ...
very many bus service in ireland be run by local transporter , small business and family business ...
rural bus service be vital to rural living ...
passengers should not suffer because this proposal , either because more restrict service or highest price ...
i support this regulation concern passengers rights in bus and coach transport ...
persistence vary level passengers protection depend on form transport be use be intolerable ...
i therefore voting in favor report on passengers rights in bus and coach transport ...
member state unfortunately work hand in glove with transport operator , and oppose stronger passengers rights ...
we note that approve change also improve on previous version , by guarantee , in particular
that transporter need to heed appropriate access condition for persons with disability and those with restrict mobility
these service should also be accessible to persons with disability
bus passengers can not and must not be only one not to be protect by eu regulation ...
i voting in favor and i congratulate mr cancian on he report , which i feel be in-depth ...
in most cases , in fact , bus transport be operate by small enterprise ...
i therefore fully support mr cancian poss proposal and he very well balanced approach ...
journey have be considerably democratise in recent annum , and we have to be happy about that ...
i voting in favor cancian report concern rights passengers in bus and coach transport ...
now we go into conciliation ...
therefore , we have voting in favor ...
concern with report voting be follow
in several amendments , responsibility compliance be tackle to port authority ...
i also appreciate fact that exceptional circumstance be adopt into account in this report ...
even if these circumstance stay exceptional , they can pose serious issue to traveller when they arise ...
this report also aim to facilitate assistance , retransportation , reimbursement and compensation for passengers in such circumstance ...
all this have to do with voting at second reading ...
it be crucial that consumer be give effective rights to ensure that liberalisation allow for real choice ...
i would love to item out that safety condition can not be neglect and make relative in any circumstance ...
complaint system should be accessible and clear to passengers ...
combate exclusion be priority for eu ...
i therefore believe that rights passengers with disability and reduce mobility should be firmly guarantee ...
new rights allow to passengers on boat and ship be to be welcome ...
this mean that there need to be investment in terminal and port ...
these passengers should also have opportunity to submit compensation claim ...
in this cases , too , it be primarily about accommodate persons with particular need ...
however , we do not consider european legislation to be right instrument for protect passengers rights ...
nerland itself be better place to make tailor political ...
this compel we to voting against this proposal ...
for these reason , i voting in favor amendments table to council poss position ...
as be cases with airlines industry , passengers merit to be protect against disruption ...
consumer rights must be protect ...
this legislation be head in right directorate , give more rights to passengers trip by boat other coach ...
passengerss on marine transport will have rights analogous to those prescribe in european legislation for aeroplane and train passengerss ...
i welcome adoption regulation concern trip by sea and inland waterways ...
i hope that acceptable compromise can be reach in conciliation ...
in order to solve increase road infrastructures issue , there be proposal to deploy advance information and communication technologies ...
effectiveness use information and communication technologies in sphere road transport be indisputable ...
correct function internal market must be ensure ...
i voting for this document , because it would accelerate implementation smart transport system solution ...
approval this draft legislative resolution be important step towards deploy smart transport system ...
if smart trafficking system be actually implementation , they must be inter-operable ...
some thought be also give to mutual appreciation and datum protection , therefore why i be give my approval ...
green efa have support jensen recommendations onintelligent transport system ...
agreement with council be adopt and directive have be finalize at second reading ...
i be happy that it be adopt with resounding majority ...
thus , formality require by eu legislation should be simplifying and harmonise ...
create large european transport area without obstacle be essential ...
green ale group support sterckx report on formality for ship at seaport ...
agreement with council be thus adopt and directive have be finalize at prime reading ...
eu airlines industry be already in terrible strait ...
better performance and highest environmental standard be be seek in this report ...
in my opinion , definite target must be set if significant result be to be achieve ...
transport be accountable for 25 % co2 emission in europe ...
it be crucial to have cleaner vehicle and more efficient transport system in order to reduce this impact ...
reality be bit different , however ...
there be not far evidence collective aspiration ...
transport sector be great importance in european internal market ...
this sector effectively enable free movement persons and products throughout eu ...
i would therefore love to item out that decarbonisation transport should be priority ...
in this context , it be value note opportunity internalise external cost ...
grosch report be splendid start item as we await european commission white document ...
report call for safest , more efficient transport which cause less pollution ...
in other word , nothing but very conventional and very obvious thing ...
nowadays poss voting call for more join up think throughout whole europe ...
i endorse final version report ...
instead make fund more flexible , we have obtain fund which have no flexibility at all ...
i would love to thank fellow member who voting to dismiss amendments transport have multifunctional character , with directly influence on economic , social and territorial matter ...
i voting for this report because i support aim european transport political ...
i be voting against this report ...
it also contribute to developmental and consolidation internal market ...
we be as far away as ever from achieve sustainability in transport ...
this report be basically almost rehash old , unfulfilled strategy ...
that be why i abstain ...
european economy , and therefore employment , depend on sustainable future transport ...
green ale group voting in favor ...
we support resolution despite risk pose by overly extremists stance already adopt by parliament ...
we must balance need to protect environment with present economic crises we be experience ...
we look favourably on heavy-duty emphasis on safety ...
this report will affect forthcoming green document on integrate transport political ...
i voting against report , as it defender total liberalisation transport political ...
unfortunately , however , finances allocate to this sector be inadequate ...
this be why i voting against amendments however , effect finance crises on transport sector should not be overlook ...
there be more to transport than merely truck , trafficking and tariff ...
it also boost employment ...
i be please to hear result nowadays poss voting ...
grosch report have propose achievement unusually ambitious goal by 20 i ca not , however , agree with one rapporteur poss proposal ...
i have doubt about proposal to create transport fund ...
parliament be directly elect by public ...
this allow assessment to be make impact european legislation on everyday living citizen ...
i believe that it be vital to create incentive for greater participation ...
it be clear that european legislation have directly impact on public ...
i voting in favor annual report by committee on petition ...
thus , outcome ca have be better ...
this be therefore instrument democratic and citizenship ...
i do have one small regret that french citizen make very little use this procedure ...
accord to report , 46 % submit petition in 2009 be deem unacceptable ...
this be far too high number ...
petition be important because they give european parliament means to connect with its constituency and vice versa ...
these goal must be maintain through sustain effort from both member state and european commission ...
this own initiative report aim to identify present difficulty and to propose some solution ...
as i be completely in agreement with these goal , i voting in favor this report ...
course , this be not just question affirm these goal loud and clearly ...
my amendments to text be insert in this vein ...
in actual chart , this mean that nearly 6 millions young persons be currently unemployed ...
only possible outcome from this be needless lengthy mandate burden shoulder by european and domestic budgetary ...
it be up to member state to invest in work establishment at political and economic level ...
other social and economic risk and cost to we society be associated with this pre eminent issue youth unemployed ...
i feel that we can not be resign to lose young european to social exclusion ...
it be intolerable that some member state be plan lower minimum salary for young persons ...
economic crises have , course , also result in highest unemployed in european eu ...
impact this have be heaviest on young persons and person approach age retirement ...
unemployed among young persons be enormous issue ...
mr turunen poss report be prime step , and i fully support it ...
youth unemployed be one most press issue face europe ...
at same time , eu must be unite when it come to common strategy ...
coherent mix educational , finance , social and employment political be require ...
that be why we abstain ...
persons under 25 be prime to be affect by present economic crises ...
it be certainly important to tighten regulation on internship ...
representative german free democratic party in european parliament have support this ...
this be unsustainable situation ...
internship should not destroy work ...
we believe that this give bad message ...
it should yet be possible to do three month unpaid internship , for example ...
there be numerous non profit make other social organization where young person can acquire exciting , interesting experience ...
however , such organization be often unable to pay any remuneration for internship ...
key factor should be duration internship ...
from then on , remuneration should also be pay ...
decision make nowadays be impracticable and go too far ...
we therefore do not support this part resolution ...
young persons should not stay unemployed more than four month this be statement with which i agree ...
youth unemployed be one europe poss most press issue ...
all member state must adopt action and fight youth unemployed by adopt domestic specificity into account ...
we must ensure growth and create new work , especially for young persons and prioritise business educational provider co-operation ...
i voting nowadays for own initiative report on combate youth unemployed ...
by adopt this report , we have decide to adopt strong action against abuse internship ...
commission and member state be ask by parliament to recommend minimum standard for internship ...
european quality charter on internship be to be propose ...
i be therefore in favor promote statute internship ...
this send out clear signal to we young european ...
we often say that young persons be future europe ...
it be awful that youth unemployed rate be double average european rate ...
unfortunately , outlook be not promise either ...
unemployed among young persons be one europe poss most press issue ...
that be why i voting as i do ...
it be mainly young persons and woman who be affect by unemployed ...
this tendency continue to grow during downturn ...
actual process get on work ladder be become increasingly difficult ...
unsafe work mean that we should not be surprise at low births rate ...
let we attempt , with council and commission , to guarantee young persons dignified salary ...
crises have hit hardest at those who be just enter labor market ...
i have no doubt that unemployed among young persons be currently one eu poss largest issue ...
even if young persons do find work , they be very often only give temporary contract ...
internship be also cause far emotion ...
european eu must have common strategy ...
this specific paragraph for whole europe have be add at particularly difficult time for young persons ...
in ideal world , youth unemployed would be outlaw ...
since 2000 , youth unemployed in brussels have never fall below 30 % ...
that be thrust turunen report ...
it skit new way to sidewalk youth unemployed ...
we must also ensure that these be good quality ...
report be adopt with large majority in favor ...
it be fundamental for europe future to guarantee full and secure employment for young persons ...
europe must have courage to invest in those business which do not relocate but create work ...
vocational training be essential ...
there should be quality charter to ensure that apprenticeship provide sensible income and be limited duration ...
tackle this be important task for accountable political ...
with 21...4 % young european under 25 unemployed , it be definitely time to adopt action ...
in lithuanium , last annum , every 11th young person be unemployed compare to every twenty 4th in 200we need to boost youth employability by help adapting educational skill to labor market need ...
support measure such as quality internship , apprenticeship and traineeship can aid smooth transitional from educational to employment ...
for lithuanium , it be vital to prevent increase cerebral drain skilled labor ...
i voting in favor gruny report , whose aim be to launch vast european employment initiative ...
my contribution be basis along two line ...
firstly , importance link between training course and need labor market ...
it also promote view thatself employmentus type work that should be promote ...
i be voting in favor bulk measure propose in this report ...
these have greater impact on young persons and woman ...
prime relate to need for increase investment in skill and professional and lifelong training ...
these worker be often deny important rights includes right to training or to join trade eu ...
crises should not serve as excuse for developmental more precarious employment ...
all worker should have access to equality treatment irrespective they employment contract ...
i fully support report and i will voting in favor its adoption ...
rigid model labor law have prove to have fail ...
society have evolve , world have change , and labor relation must inevitably accompany this change ...
set basic rights for all employee should be secure , irrespective employment statute ...
i yet defender urgent extension protection to work undertake in atypical form employment ...
eu can not abandon its european social model , but should rather strengn it ...
many report poss article be example this , namely , when it say that it
unemployed persons and worker must not expect welcome from brussels quite contrary !
crises must not serve as excuse for developmental casual work ...
all employee must be protect by labor law , whatever form they contract adopt ...
nowadays poss labor market and its associated employment relationship be characterise by one word flexicurity ...
i therefore support mr gruny poss report ...
i nowadays voting in favor gruny own initiative report on atypical employment contract in eu ...
this allow we to send out two clear message to labor market ...
atypical employment contract must stay exception in europe ...
transitional must be make to stable , protect , better quality employment contract ...
fast pace structural change necessitate more flexible form work ...
abuse atypical employment breach european social model ...
dialogue and collective negotiation can contribute greatly to improve and preserving labor market ...
report adopt well define guideline and specific measure for safeguard work , ensure high quality employment throughout europe ...
european eu be face major finance , economic and social crises ...
report as adopt in committee have be adopt in plenary ...
text be not harm but relatively weak ...
there be , unfortunately , no chance to secure majority for it ...
incidence atypical employment contract be increase significantly in european eu ...
analysis present in gruny report be therefore good and to be welcome ...
we therefore go further in we alternative resolution ...
there must not be two class employment contract ...
that resolution do not make it , and parliament pass up opportunity to construct stronger social europe ...
action be certainly desirable , therefore , and so i welcome position whole european parliament ...
this be important ...
neverless , i believe that eu should not involve itself in form employment ...
this be matter that must instead be agreement with at domestic level ...
in my home country , collective agreement to agreement with these matter be negotiate by autonomous party ...
increase resource efficiency in europe be among priority goal eu 2020 strategy ...
allow i to give you one example this ...
bioga be precious resource use to produce electricity and fuel for transport and for supply gas network ...
bio waste have role to play in more global matter fight against climate change ...
we must therefore totally separate bio waste from standard waste , which be worst solution in lengthy mandate ...
instead , we should use it for composting or for produce bioenergy , as report strongly emphasise ...
finally , there be great diversity between member state in mandate present management bio waste ...
in order to managing bio waste effectively , priority should be waste prevention or reduction ...
effective bio waste management can contribute to eu target at least 20 % renewable energy by 20selective collection and recycling bio waste be essential to europe poss sustainable developmental ...
new legislation should prescribe requirement for system selective bio waste collection and recycling ...
treatment waste be issue that affect europe and all humanity ...
firstly , i would love to congratulate rapporteur , mr fernande , for he splendid work ...
present legislation in mandate bio waste do not answer requirement material poss regulation ...
efficient management bio waste not only bring environmental benefit but also contribute favourably to social and economic sphere ...
i be therefore voting in favor this report poss proposal ...
ever greater area be experience irreparable soil degradation here ...
globally , bio waste be most often put in landfill and only tiny percentage be sort and reprocess ...
european now understand need to sort waste ...
however , bio waste almost always end up in landfill ...
report agreement with issue adequately , and i will voting in favor its adoption ...
it be estimation that amount bio waste produce in eu every annum be around 100 millions tonne ...
we position be ambitious and realistic ...
although we broadly agree with these principle , we can not , however , neglect to item out some issue ...
question unanswered in report be who will pay ?
reduction be one better way combate issue relate to waste ...
as regard composting , it be not enough to say that we need to do it ...
satisfying management bio waste would therefore have not only environmental advantage , but also economic one ...
action must be adopt at eu level and nowadays poss voting should ensure that progress be make ...
this report adopt right approach ...
i will therefore abstain ...
bio waste can also be reuse to produce bio energy and biofuel ...
recycling industry currently create around 250 work for each 10 000 tonne waste recycling ...
one strategic goal waste management political be to transform eu into recycling society ...
this mean that sustainable developmental can be promote through efficient resource management ...
draft report already contain most relevant issue for we green ...
this be includes in recital text adopt in committee ...
we be in favor commission poss green document on management bio waste ...

economic governance in eu and eurozone , and surveillance domestic budgetary debate
mr president , lady and gentleman , economic governance represent crucial challenge for future we eu ...
commissioner oll i rehn then discuss this with you during he hearing ...
unfortunately , crises have show that we be right ...
as result , commission provide detailed proposal on 12 may ...
these proposal do not involve change treaty ...
we must act now , within legal context that we have nowadays ...
this be not limitation ...
we citizen , we business and we economy be demand that we adopt initiative ...
it be we responsibility to decide and to act now ...
because economic crises , european eu have be face with series serious testing ...
as i say this morning , agreement be within reach in come day ...
we response to crises be holistic one ...
we stabilise , we consolidate and we modernize ...
we prepare we social market economy to ensure better future for we citizen ...
but for now , let i focus on governance ...
we have treaty provision in place which allow we to act ...
we have institution ...
we need to make it work ...
we face real risk and we successfully resist it ...
now we be fill in gap we have identify to pre empt such risk for future ...
i prime announce to parliament idea we flesh out in commission communication 12 may ...
we debate since then be reflect in commission communication 30 june ...
this work have help to build real european momentum ...
i hope that this will translate later into swift consideration and swift adoption legislative proposal ...
we approach to economic governance be to have rule that be more comprehensive and more efficient ...
we need stronger surveillance system ...
what do this mean in details ?
prime , we need more coordination ...
key to this be european semester ...
it will improve economic transparency and encourage peer review , ex ante , among member state ...
second , we need credibility that come with better implementation ...
this mean refine incentive and sanction toolkit , more effective mix both preventive and corrective action ...
i wanna to be very clear on this ...
parliament can be reassure that commission will do its utmost to ensure that this will be cases ...
timing measure be also key ...
we must not fall into trap wait too lengthy before sanction lower in ...
incentive and sanction must be bring upstream so that action be deploy before situation get out hand ...
preventive action can be far more effective than corrective action but it require discipline and political will ...
we be tackle this in we proposal , in particular , as regard euro area ...
third , we surveillance need to capture all key element ...
it must not be restrict to fiscal political alone ...
we have see that such narrow perspective do not work ...
we must have tool to detect macro economic imbalance among member state ...
such imbalance weaken cohesion eu and , in particular , euro area ...
comprehensive dashboard indicator will give we what we need to identify increase divergence and to propose redress ...
they need , course , to be complement by appropriate implementation mechanism for such redress ...
european council endorse it fortnight ago ......... about .........
i would love to underline historic dimensions reform we be put forward ...
this be not just addition different strategy ...
applause
president barroso , commissioner rehn , you proposal be important step towards strengn economic governance in europe ...
it also wish to cooperate on adopt next step towards community method ...
we have great expectation european semester and coordination domestic action program ...
important reform and painful measure in member state be necessary in order to strengn they competitiveness ...
this will create work and prosperity for we citizen ...
you call series measure atoolbox ...
great agreement will depend on specific content this toolkit ...
one we dutch soccer team have mottodeed not word ...
fiscal stability can not exists in isolation from strong economic growth and high level employment ...
in you proposal last week , i think you be miss item ...
you have leave out several highly relevant option that would really mean qualitative leap in this field ...
second , you must come forward with economic political agenda for work and fiscal consolidation ...
nowadays , we only have agenda for cut deficit at detriment work ...
taxation on labor be far too high in number member state ...
i hope you will reconsider and come forward with more balanced set proposal in autumn ...
commission have initiative here ...
neverless , mr president , some question stay concern this package ...
prime question , which be fundamental , be who will managing this economic governance ?
we can not just say that we will reduce deficit ...
4th element be stress testing ...
i be satisfy with fact that decision have be adopt to publish these ...
this be crucial item ...
furthermore , this element be repeat in commission poss proposal ...
member state have not yet understand ...
mr president , many acknowledgements for make this statement ...
it also specifically mention imbalance ...
until recently , it be yet almost impossible to talk about imbalance severely ...
this clearly mean economic governance and also talk about tax issue ...
these must stop be taboo subject and clearly have place in such statement ...
secondly , it be not enough to coordinate budgetary political only in way it be describe ...
we must ensure that budgetary political be ant i cyclical , enable it therefore to counteract crises ...
unfortunately , this do not feature in text ...
unfortunately , you be yet lack courage to explain thing as clearly as be necessary ...
we have issue with asset price and foam ...
this be not mention explicitly either ...
it be no longer enough now to make progress in this crises ...
we need to arrive at consensus ...
outcome need to be fully implementation by all 27 member state and be fully comply with ...
recent finance and economic crises have necessitate bold measure ...
i do not agree with this conclude ...
both commission and council be call for further control and penalty for member state in deficit ...
this have not work in past and will not work in future ...
regulation finance market be matter urgency ...
we will do we part to resolve situation ...
europe poss citizen already have to pay council now ought finally to swing into action as well ...
this may stall growth in euro area , which be yet feeble and at risk ...
these country must make greater effort to strengn they domestic market and boost demand instead ...
what be need be to carry out fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its condition ...
i think you have urgent appointment ...
you be in such pumpkin actually , be you not ?
what in fact happen when you introduce it be that you actually tear up you own rule book ...
you throw it away !
i be not johnny come lately to demise euro ...
it be always write in rune , as it be ...
to suggest now that we have only just find out that greece be break be intellectually unfair ...
we commercial bank have get themselves into terrible issue because they buy junk debt ...
they redistribute junk debt repackage at triple rating ...
what be we central bank do now ?
very same thing ...
you have promise convergence and harmonisation european country ...
nowadays , you be rush we towards social and political explosion ...
errare humanum est , perseverare diabolicum to err be human , to persist be devil ...
prime all , to corien wortmann kool , thank you for you support ...
that be precisely we goal with youth 20so we proposal be not only about prudence in macro economic aspect ...
that be why i also do not agree with idea that we approach be not balance ...
we will come with formal proposal ...
what be go on be very important reform ...
but we also wanna to includes in this holistic approach macro economic surveillance with tif ...
it be not only about sanction for those who do not fulfil criterion depth and deficit ...
we will also attempt to reinforce coordination in mandate macro economic imbalance ...
we need this since we whole reform be basis on this new architecture ...
in last few day , new belgian presidency have renew momentum towards agreement ...
there be predominant sense constructive pragmatism on both side ...
i be grateful for aspiration parliament have be demonstrate ...
i be grateful for you strong support ...

fully transparent stress testing provide opportunity to do so ...

i believe that stability euro be in interest all we citizen ...
applause
president barroso , thank you for you approach and for you co-operation with european parliament ...
debate be close ...
write statement rule 149
i welcome proposal make by commission ...
europe be about mutual and close interdependency ...
however , control mechanism be not solution but just means ...
they should not be overestimate ...
solution be in more efficient work , entrepreneurship and innovation ...
key to solution be prevention ...
particular care should be pay to budgetary framework and state debt ...
instead break finance control into smaller cluster , monitoring macro economic situation as whole be need ...
new dual system incentive and sanction merit support ...
i also encourage make better use eurostat ...
reliable and timely datum be crucial component to make right decision ...
i should love to draw fellow membersattention to issue domestic budgeting ...
this be all result illogical and unclear tax legislation ...
in individual cases , tax authority personnel can apply thisturbidlegislation in any way they choose ...
this have lead to bankruptcy many business and commercial structure ...
what be happen in tax sphere in latvium nowadays can be describe in one word illegality !
in essence , state be deprive entrepreneur they liquid fund ...
next item be joint debate on follow
mr president , at origin this finance crises be domestic supervisor ...
at this stage , and with enormous crises we be suffer , there be only two opportunity ...
british split main finance regulator and give more power and more clout to bank england ...

commission have be give necessary power to ensure its adoption within anticipate timeframe ...
all competence and power have be incorporate into sectoral legislation ...
i hope that negotiation on this directive can be bring to satisfying conclude ...
parliament have follow message , which be support by large , overall majority ...
since then , we have have wide range debate about many issue ...
they also would have expect these authority to be subsidy strong investor and consumer protection rights ...
this be decision we have come to now in parliament ...
there also seem , fortunately , to be broad consensus that this step be necessary ...
we also stress in parliament on new authority receive rights allow they to ban risky finance product ...
this be other cases where we have to fight against suggestion be water down ...
key item stay if real finance crises break out , who declare emergency ?
will council ever do this ?
it be stress that fox should be put in charge henhouse ...
this do not make any sense , fact which commission have also continually item out ...
so far , council appear rigid ...
it must be cases large amount be allocate by means decision at european level ...
it be now over to council ...
since then , commission have do its work ...
it commission report from jacque de larosi?there ...
prime , there be issue concern efficiency ...
we do not need safeguard clause ...
on this question , i would neverless love to make comment ...
who do member state wanna to protect themselves from when they plan safeguard clause against europe ?
we also wanna these authority to be locate in single place , for reason efficiency ...
on this matter , we have also make some application ...
we have also ask for greater openness from these body ...
i would love to say one final word relate to unite state ...
i be always shock when persons tell we that u...s... have pull ahead ...
i also notice that number government be have debate in two stage ...
prime , we refuse any federal state ...
we refuse any new stage integration and we decry community method ...
then , later , we always compare ourselves to unite state ...
there come time when we have to abide by we responsibility ...
i wanna stronger europe ...

parliament have give great agreement ground in order to reach agreement commission too ...
belgian presidency have show great willing ...

there be several idea that parliament would love to highlight ...
what do it mean to say that they be european ?
domestic supervisor can not be feudal lord invest with absolute power ...

this be sign strength this house ...
it must not make use this time to attempt and put together block minority in opposition to parliament ...

it stay most comprehensive piece sectoral finance service legislation voting on in this parliament ...
as such , creditworthiness i i be intimately link with proposal for eiopa ...
it be perhaps because my experience with creditworthiness i i that i be keen to adopt on this report ...
i know that it be context in which we ca make creditworthiness i i really work ...
insurance be not banking and i be glad that my fellow rapporteur have accept that ...
they will not be different but they will be balance ...
this be real win for parliament ...
for pension , question be up in air ...
we need to attribute wider power interference to supervisor ...
we need to prepare contingency plan ...
this entire process adopt time for 27 member state ...
however , around 50 12 000 bank operate europe represent 70 % asset ...
this mean enormous concentration risk , but also opportunity to intervene primarily in they ...
as you well know , latest trialogue actually adopt place yesterday evening ...
should presidency esrb be elect , or should he other she be automatic ecb president ?
should president efc participate in work esrb ?
there again , agreement be not far away ...
i count on you support on these very important endeavor ...
there be many subject which be part this architecture prevention , crises management and supervision ...
there be also finance departmental governance and banking capital ...
i will come back to this when talk about mr karasreport ...
i would love to say few word on two subject for nowadays ...
prime , i will tackle supervision , which be effectively backbone ...
we need this credible european architecture supervision ...
we find here spirit and philosophy commission poss proposal ...
i be think reinforcement joint committee , as defender by mr skinner ...
these be only few example most difficult thing yet lie ahead we ...
margallo they marfil say ... garc ?
we need council to understand that now be time to act and to make progress ...
other have also say this ...
ball be in its court to use these few day to reach smart and credible agreement ...
you can count on i to be available ...
i have myself believe in precaution measure for lengthy time ...
that be spirit toolkit that we will be present to council minister ...
i make commitment that legislative text will be present to you ...
i would love to say that i be speak as shadow rapporteur for opinion ...
there have be different approach adopt at domestic level ...
it be obvious that this can not work ...
what citizen wanna be for effective decision to be make to get issue resolve ...
council only adopt narrow inclined approach ...
public do not find this political acceptable ...
we expect council to adopt action ...
this mean he can issue warn , make recommendations , and all this in public ...
i really do regard this as extremely positive move which should be highlight ...
madam president , commissioner , european supervision finance market be minimum that we can do ...
it will require regulation rating agency ...
as result , issue control have not be resolve control must be political ...
it be also insufficient if we do not adopt real measure against vol capital to tax haven ...
regulation at european level be useful , but insufficient ...
we must have global supervision finance market ...
we can not simply allow thing to carry on in this dysfunctional and incoherent manner ...
equally , new european framework must radically improve both quality and consistency regulatory supervision ...
we member state be right to resist such move ...
british and germany be right to adopt position that they have ...
let we now begin debate with political group orator ...
issue have already be explain ...
we be agreement with market which operate globally nowadays ...
member state yet believe that they can use they domestic supervisory structure to apply rule in this environment ...
this be task to which we have commit ourselves as european parliament ...
as be well know , european parliament be not army extremists make revolutionary demand ...
we proposal be those de larosi?there , not robespierre , as fine commissioner barnier know ...
friend in council , even if you be not here , you will read we word ...
expensive friend in council , do not bury you head in sable love ostrich ...
reality be tough , but it must be face with choice courage and strength ...
if they be toxic , why authorise they ?
it be clearly ask for mandatory action ...
all this do not seem to i to amount to extremism ...
i can think no other name for that than political federation ...
here lie essence entire debate on finance architecture and supervision finance architecture ...
we have currency eu ...
citizen sit here and watch we may quite rightly ask so what be you solution ?
we need to do something without give you say ...
in my opinion , that be bad approach ...
council and government do not wanna strong interference rights ...
mr giegold be right when he describe what be currently go on asparochial ...
we will get fragmentary supervisory structure which will be incapable exercise proper control over finance market ...
this would be just prime step to statute quo ante ...
it be finally time for grandiose promise to be back up by action ...
my group support strong european regulation ...
i miracle , however , wher road we be about to engage upon be right one ...
finally , i be convince that politics should adopt more responsibility ...
de madam president , european eu already have around 40 eu agency ...
every annum , these organization gobble up eur 1...5 billion ...
council and member state have never have any issue make quick fire decision to establish such agency ...
most all , there be frequently no rationale give for these agency ...
unfortunately , they often adopt ludicrous stance ...
in this debate on european supervision , parliament have play this role ...
why be this ?
in these trouble time , european systemic risk board must get to work as rapidly as possible ...
however , this be only start ...
unity european single market must also be supervise if we wanna to avoid its segmentation ...
they be also concentrate more on substance than on turf war ...
standardise derivative will be trade on establish exchange and force through clear house ...
we be discuss how to distribute power between european institution and domestic institution ...
well , solution be quite easy ...
instead , monitoring should begin in we country ...
in italy , for example , it happen via system local branch which can monitor situation well ...
furthermore , why should headquarters european agency be in frankfurt ?
who decide that ?
it should also contribute to emergence single banking market eu ...
i be glad that it appear that we be close to agreement ...
in retrospect , it seem astonishing that we do not have single eu wide macro prudential body do just this ...
i be extremely happy to see how close we be to final agreement ...
we should all , and rapporteur themselves , be very proud ...
de madam president , we need more supervision finance market in europe too ...
economic and finance crises have make it glaringly and painfully obvious that opportunity be miss in past ...
european finance supervisory authority must be provide with extensive power ...
they must not degenerate into vacuum shell which passively observe market developmental ...
council must finally accept european parliament as legislator equality standing ...
there have certainly be no lack preparatory work by accountable pem ...
numerous debate have adopt place and work have be carry out in parliament rapidly and purposefully ...
we be now wait for council to provide clear answer and concrete proposal in write ...
hu crises have teach we all some painful lesson ...
new supervisory authority will serve exactly this purpose ...
parliament should also make concession ...
finally , ecofin should be subsidy right to announce economic crises ...
fr madam president , i be happy to find my friend michel barnier in this chamber ...
i be think international public banking establishment and , in particular , european investment bank ...
datum which will be collect by those three institution will be very important and will be partially confidential ...
we must do everything in we power so that this do not happen again ...
we need regulation and supervision ...
we need independence , strong authority in interest european ...
what unite state have succeed in do , european eu must also do ...
this be only way open to we to change thing , and this be why we must succeed ...
however , effort to create stricter regulation and closer supervision will not , by themselves , prevent potential crises ...
we need more involvement from europe ...
proposal table by commission already provide minimum scenario ...
we need strong supervision with tooth , right interference and mediator function ...
we need decision without further notice in emergency ...
we require banking supervision as part crises management ...
we need strong supervision with tooth ...
it be very good that eu be not passive in ensure finance security ...
let we remember to link responsibility eu to responsibility all member state ...
these interference rights be restrict to absolutely exceptional cases and will fortunately never be use ...
we wanna to keep systemic risk permanently to minimum ...
for sake taxpayer , we need more involvement from europe , not less ...
if they fail to perform , they have someone to answer to ...
that be key message ...
i would love to conclude by say that i have no issue with institution be basis in frankfurt ...
after all , germany have be better model finance propriety than many other ...
issue be that we ignore asset inflation ...
i will report all those matter to he which may concern he directly ...
mr bowle remind we need for early interference measure ...
i think that these be good idea ...
we be indeed carry out this reform for citizen ...
this be very far reform for citizen ...
mr lull mention item which be interest to my fellow , oll i rehn ...
mr klinz , i would love to thank you for support that you be show we ...
you remind we importance apply we rule properly ...
that must be engage upon , mr giegold , well before we talk about ban ...
i ca imagine important coordinate role for authority in this area ...
council also accept that authority may have such role ...
mr baldassarre mention worry that mr lehne also have concern power authority ...
this have to do with trans-atlantic calibration that i sometimes mention ...
i be not worry about energetic interaction between u...s... and european ...
at moment , 80 % finance exchange adopt place on both side atlantique ...
other region world be there , between u...s... and european ...
we therefore have same road map ...
also , last g20 be something follow up g20 , in my view ...
u...s... adopt different method from we own they adopt global package ...
they will now need to open drawer one by one to implementation these decision ...
i think that there be real side between u...s... and european ...
we be not always use same tool , and we will not always use same method ...
we banking sector be quite dissimilar ...
i would remind you that in europe , bank finance between two third and three trimester economy ...
in unite state , it be other way around ...
we do not always have same banking structure ...
on this subject , we be have confident dialogue with u...s... , but one without naïvety ...
that be what i would say in conclude , and i thank you for you speech ...
in my cases , i ca argue that spain would probably have have big corralito ...
euro be create 11 annum ago ...
i believe that we should make use time and reach speedy agreement ...
those who defender self regulation in past now need to accept self financing ...
they have do splendid work , which have not yet bear fruits ...
it be pity therefore that my fellow member be no longer present ...
however , one thing which be also important to i be this compromise which we be now produce ...
parliament table last minutes compromise last week ...
it do not work if inch be give ultimately result in mile be adopt ...
this method will fail ...
i hope that this signal be also clearly understand by absent council ...
otherwise , we be all go to find it very uncomfortable next week ...
mr president , commissioner , i would love to say three thing ...
let we be quite clear ...
we have make effort ...
this parliament agree to interrupt procedure prime reading ...
this should not end up as cherry pick ...
no ...
i can not mention all they ...
this be we line this be what we believe in for reason efficiency ...
my second remark have to do with dated ...
it be 1 january with good reason ...
we have advantage that we anticipate thing that other institution say later ...
president cut off orator
he repliedno , it be far more serious than that ...
i would love to thank everybody who have participate in this ...
we have converge from different directorate but we have come out with strong parliament voice ...
we should be proud ...
on international level , we should be proud too ...
however , i do not inevitably agree with you on international finance accountancy ...
you will not be surprise to hear that ...
i do not agree with use historic tendency ...
neverless , on supervision , rapporteur merit pat on back ...
we have go through full time , we be now in additional time ...
let we hope it do not have to go to penalty shoot out ...
i will attempt to be very brief here in underline just four item ...
particular mention for office staff , for susanna vravova , and for service committee ...
joint debate be close ...
voting will adopt place tomorrow , wed , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 ...
write statement rule 149
european eu have political , social and moral duty to intervene ...
that duty find its justification in value underlie eu and enshrine in treaty ...
economy can only function with healthy finance market dedicate to it ...
european finance stability facility and european finance stabilisation mechanism and future action debate
we be devil that look at details , and we wanna more it ...
on 11 may , european stabilisation mechanism be establish utilise eu budgetary ...
bit more haste would have be useful , and perhaps cheaper ...
can you confirm that rule spv be be change to permit this ?
there stay many other question ...
how will coordination between stabilisation fund and imf operate ?
be this all right way around ?
should imf be top up eu rescue , or should it be other way round ?
be spv active now or must prime call use eu budgetary mechanism ?
market force be not popular right now ...
mr bowle mention angel ...
i do not know if there be many angel when we talk finance service ...
prime question what amount be we talk about when we talk this european stabilisation mechanism ?
what be link with ceiling on own resource ?
that be precise response that mr rehn wanna to give to you on this item ...
second question will commission carry out impact analysis for these two instrument ?
this report will be transmit to economic and finance committee and council ...
notably , it will includes impact assessment text ...
third question what be impact on finance capacity eib ?
it will not lend or borrow on name this mechanism ...
no accurate choice legal basis have yet be make ...
you have just mention question role european parliament ...
european parliament will be keep inform any change regard all these new procedure ...
sixth question what be coordination with international monetary fund ?
8th and final question relate to choice legal basis ...
this would have be difficult to reconcile with lengthy procedure involve important role for some domestic parliament ...
however , i wish to say follow on subject ...
in we view , finance stabilisation mechanism be not substitute for development european monetary fund ...
finance stabilisation mechanism exemplify urgency finance market reform ...
in meantime , market have do they work ...
we fellow member , mr kara , speak stability pact ...
nowadays , we have mechanism that be put together in emergency , as you remind we ...
we do this in emergency ...
president cut off orator
this be good course action ...
thank you for you understanding ...
we now move on to orator in catch eye procedure ...
besides , issue arise concern dependency rating agency ...
i find , therefore , that this measure have not be think through well enough ...
it pose risk again member state run up debt at detriment and liability or ...
i believe that this be quid stabilisation ...
any reduction this program would be totally counterproductive ...
would you have suggestion to make on this ?
i would simply love to ask you question , commissioner ...
he will do this in write in next few day ...
i refer you to quite comprehensive response that president barroso give on this question ...
however , this be only tool , mr kara ...
these idea will also be turn into legislative proposal at end 2010 and start 20mr ber?s mention implementation stability pact ...
love you , i think that we must go further ...
as you have understand , we introduce this european finance stabilisation mechanism in time emergency ...
commission have also make important proposal relate to budgetary surveillance ...
debate be close ...
voting will adopt place on wed , 7 july 2010 at 12 00 ...
next item be joint debate on
it will force bank to hold more capital against riskier activity on trade book ...
we be constantly tell by bank that they have learning lesson crises ...
it be therefore imperative that these rule on bonus apply in 20colleague , we have duty , as legislator , to defend taxpayersinterest ...
we have duty to respond to public poss concern ...
we voter demand and expect bank to prioritise stability and lending over bankersown pay and bonus ...
in last two annum , since 2008 , bank have fail to reform they structure ...
to begin with , it be important to exercise and expand sound internal and external supervision remuneration political ...
remuneration itself must reflect company poss lengthy mandate performance as far as possible ...
bonus should not just be guarantee ...
percentage variable remuneration should be pay out over sufficient duration ...
i think that we can go even further in this matter ...
i agree with you observation , mr el khadraou i ...
there must be mandatory measure on remuneration political finance institution ...
payments bonus to director bank receive state aid be greatly restrict ...
i think that that be fair ...
i also welcome fact that these measure must be implementation by member state from 1 january 20thi be one key element more robust and more stable regulatory framework ...
i have begin this task ...
i recently put forward international agenda for finance regulation for growth ...
this be one application make in you report , mr el khadraou i ...
we shall open two month duration genuine consultation on all these issue ...
thirdly , there be matter modernisation capital treatment ...
i have just refer to crd three and issue remuneration ...
i be very aware this risk ...
i be aware that these negotiation on crd three have sometimes be very difficult ...
madam president , lady and gentleman , council be again absent ...
during negotiation , council come out on side bonus recipient ...
european parliament be in favor clear european regulation ...
we be in favor maximum limit ...
we be in favor payments method involve less risk ...
we be in favor liability ...
we be in favor restriction on bonus for manager bank support with public fund ...
we do not wanna species amount to be highest than tie up capital ...
we have managing to get we way with splitting timetable ...
it be also important that we have adapting trade book and banking book ...
we support this compromise as it adopt we further in right directorate ...
on other hand , there have be very few specific measure ...
this legislation will most likely reduce short sight and exaggerated risk adopt in finance sector ...
that will reduce risk level and increase stability ...
it be too risky for society to largely accept statute quo ...
yes , i mean up there alongside supervisory architecture ...
madam president , commissioner , my political group be particularly delighted that this directive have be adopt ...
it be directive which arguably contain most ambitious rule in world on remuneration factor ...
i must say , commissioner , that commission have largely be on we side in this struggle ...
therefore , i think that this be achievement which we can share ...
now , there be important issue at stake ...
as we lose , we have have to make compromise ...
we have here regulation which be unique on global scale ...
after all , any manager who be successful and accountable also wanna to continue make good live ...
this be fundamental change towards greater sustainability and cost efficiency , and fortunately away from gaming ...
thank you to all fellow member for they co-operation on this report ...
it be clear that we need principle that promote and create guideline for sound remuneration political ...
at same time , we must avoid broad generalisation and blame sector as whole ...
in end , we succeed in achieve relatively balanced result ...
de madam president , mr kara have already mention some key item ...
i fully concur with he on they ...
i think that we need better capital requirement for finance institution in both qualitative and quantitative mandate ...
however , it do not help to force situation as this ca have totally contrary effect ...
finance crises be clearly global crises ...
lesson we need to draw from it must therefore be draw at global level as well ...
this mean that if we tighten capital requirement , we must coordinate this measure internationally too ...
level play field must be retain ...
calculation example in annex must also match formulation ...
however , future supervisory authority will be accountable for interpretation ...
there be one other thing we should not forget ...
finance economy and real economy be not two self contain system ...
it will not be that easy to put end to this ...
attempt to make management executive more accountable with retention be thwart by new insurance political ...
eu draft should draw lesson from this ...
factor determine bonus must definitely be transparent ...
madam president , i would love to thank rapporteur and commission ...
we only know about surplus banking sector because disaster that have happen ...
transparency be key to all this ...
when persons have expertise what be happen , then we can adopt action on it ...
clear rule have be implementation which can not be interpret in different way ...
this be aim debate we be have with council at this very moment ...
this includes , mr canfin , decision on rule relate to remuneration ...
i should now love to say few word about implementation these new rule ...
they must apply to all investment banking firm ...
mr christensen , you stress need for transparency ...
mr bowle mention central issue capitalization , as do mr balz short while ago ...
capitalization be indeed important ...
we need to achieve exactly same goal ...
they have be set by gwe must achieve they in side , and i shall be careful to ensure that this do indeed happen ...
i believe , fellow , that it be begin process , not end ...
therefore , i urge fellow to give strong voting to this report in plenary tomorrow ...
mr president , lady and gentleman , i too shall keep it brief ...
it can not be end history ...
it be clear that there be yet work to be do ...
supervisor must be strengn so as to enable external monitoring , too , companiesremuneration political ...
role shareholder must also be strengn ...
debate be close ...
voting will adopt place tomorrow wed , 7 july 2010 ...

novel foods debate
indeed , we often hold debate here on foods that have be tinker with ...
innovation be all well and good , but not at detriment human living and health ...
what exactly arenovel foods ?
one example this be nanotechnology ...
manufacturer would love to place this on market ...
consumer always love newness , and indeed new technologies can help we combat obesity , for example ...
foods should not reach we plaque unless its safety be guarantee ...
now for stumble block meat from clone animal and they offspring ...
clone animal be often cripple or sick , and most be not even alive when they be bear ...
in other word , there be little sign respect for animal welfare ...
debate on clone meat be not new ...
european parliament have be debate cloning animal since back in 002 council adopt view that meat from clone animal should fall under novel foods legislation ...
therefore , parliament be unable to reach agreement with council at second reading ...
therefore , i make emphatic call for separate legislation on cloning animal ...
we must not produce any unpleasant surprise at last moment ...
i be grateful for parliament poss broad support for improvement proposal to streamline authorisation procedure ...
regard animal cloning , i share importance that parliament attach to this highly sensitive issue ...
i look forward to hear view member ...
it agreement with novel foods and new process for manufacture foodsstuff ...
i agree that new definition be need , but we should not limit ourselves to definition and tag ...
i hope and trust that this will be cases ...
effect nanomaterial on human body be unidentified ...
we must do we utmost to guarantee safe consumption ...
we represent citizen and we must not forget this fact ...
most we would also agree that question transparency be crucial when we tackle this dossier ...
we therefore need to guarantee public access to datum on which risk assessment for novel foods be basis ...
transparency should also apply when we speak about tag product from animal feed by gmo ...
these be foodss manufacture use new output technique , foodss that do not exists before 15 may 199we wanna commission to present legislative proposal without delay , and we be really push for this ...
absent council have accept only very limited number amendments from we prime reading ...
i hope commission do keep its promise to produce not just report but actual legislative proposal ...
i believe this be something european public really need and be call for ...
can these thing affect we health ?
if so , should they therefore be includes in regulation on pharmaceutical product ?
it make sense to have eu legislation in this area , but there be many different interest involve ...
who actually wanna these new initiative ?
be it industry that wanna to sell more product ?
or be it really consumer ?
i do not believe it be latter ...
in europe , we can easily feed ourselves without need for clone product ...
precise purpose these regulation be to safeguard foods safety and human health ...
unfortunately , however , reality be far duller ...
need i remind you that technologies be use to obtain such foods be yet experimental in many respects ...
group european persons poss party christian democrat can not support she on every item ...
we adopt different view regard additive and animal feed with feed derive from gmo plant ...
however , she have do splendid work ...
i also wanna to thank we shadow rapporteur , mr ayuso , for splendid work she have do ...
follow important reason be put forward during debate in group ...
we do not need it ...
population be very evidently against it , as state by all survey ...
i be sure that we be not just talk here about vague gut sense ...
it contain so many unanswered question , warrant this sense unease ...
clone animal suffer ...
they often need to be put to sleep because they have terrible illness ...
animal protection be not just principle which we can apply willy nilly ...
complainant treaty have impose this on we ...
we must absolutely avoid create law which fail to adopt animal protection into consideration ...
it be for these reason that we will be support it tomorrow too , with large majority ...
we have interesting debate too on this regulation , which be also fill with polemic ...
commissioner , i believe that you say that we have consensus ...
with novel foods , we need prior authorisation before they enter market ...
this would not conform to notion internal market and homogeneity health and live condition ...
we be not call for ban on gmo and nanomaterial ...
great agreement have already be say about meat from clone animal ...
i would love you , commissioner , to remove this section from novel foods regulation ...
this would pave way for regulation on all other topic which be not controversial ...
agreement be not reach between party during trialogue ...
we all know about extremely rigorous cross compliance rule ...
please adopt into account rather difficult situation currently face farmerss and ensure fair competition for european farmerss ...
this be how we can recognize benefit certain healthier novel foods ...
i find it regrettable to have only one ideological opinion on issue clone animal ...
european commission have pledge to put proposal to we ...
do we not already have enough rule govern foods ?
we certainly do need it ...
if there be go to be novel foodss regulation , it should really only apply to novel foodss ...
situation be different with regard to nanotechnology , which be new procedure ...
however , we should avoid demonise this new technologies , as have often happen in past ...
we must not stand in way progress ...
i be astounded at information that be already available and at search that have be carry out ...
we certainly yet need to do this with nanotechnology , but opportunity which it open up be enormous ...
we should continue to utilise and promote they ...
i look forward to find out what will be put before we ...
these animal have suffer premature ageing or other illness ...
clone animal suffer ...
most clone organism have not survive other have die prematurely ...
successful rate be one viable organism in 75 cloning attempt ...
last but not least , cloning also raise issue about safety use these technique ...
this technique be yet too dangerous to be use for directly benefit mankind ...
it be serious ethical issue ...
we must guarantee that it be safe ...
firstly , legislation must have scientific basis ...
we decision must be basis on relevant search , and on goal and well conduct science ...
it must not be question personal taste , religion conviction or particular interest ...
consumer will dismiss novel foods if they can not be certain that what we be offer be indeed safe ...

prime be environmental requirement in industrial plant ...
i have hear many argument in this debate ...
i do not love to remember my past , but i come from former gdr , east germany ...
we be not talk about thing which be not available on contrary , this be up to dated technologies ...
this directive represent significant step forward in control industrial pollution in european eu ...
it also provide we with opportunity to stimulate eco innovation ...
mr president , i would love to begin by thank mr krahmer for have push for ambitious legislation ...
it be therefore value voting for ...
i be happy that we succeed in achieve this ...
this place germany at competitive disadvantage compare to or ...
this be argument that can apply to many aspect environmental legislation ...
there have to be level play field ...
question be that we have now recast this legislation ...
member state have get off hook ...
my member state , unite kingdom , have get off hook ...
it have not do what germany do ...
mr president , i shall keep it brief , as nerland uruguay match be yet go on ...
i shall keep it brief , then , as i wanna to catch end game ...
in light this , i be truly disappoint with course negotiation ...
neverless , when all be say and do , i be definite supporter this tighten up ...
at end day , that be what this be all about ...
we be to be give level play field and we be to have clean air ...
at end day , however , we be make progress ...
i believe that match be now over , and that nerland have reach final ...
sadly , england ca not be there , but never mind we can not have everything ...
we have reach , in end , what be acceptable compromise ...
member state be not particularly happy ...
certainly some member this house be very unhappy ...
i hope mr eickhout poss unhappiness be mitigate later but , neverless , it be good overall result ...
at end day , that be always consumer ...
this be also approach we support for tetrachloride dioxide and or greenhouse gas emission ...
this commitment ensure that this vary reality will be observe ...
this apply in particular to transitional domestic plan which will apply to large power plant ...
unfortunately , electricity market be not yet single market ...
it will adopt time to achieve that goal ...
commissioner , you say it yourself ...
after all , previous directive dated from 1996 that be , 14 annum ago !
thus we have great successful , though it be spoil somewhat by large combustion plant ...
small alevins be arrest , while big fish be allow to go free ...
what happen so often in living be also unfortunately happen here with industrial plant ...
c it be clearly very important to press for reduction in emission hazardous substance by industry ...
this process be very important ...
this be least we must do for sake human health and environment ...
even after this directive , situation will not really be good anywhere in europe ...
around 95 % poland energy sector be basis on coal ...
adoption krahmer report will put enterprise in difficult situation ...
this be economically and technically problematical ...
this should be make to apply only to new investment ...
it be basis on dogmatic principle ...
it lead to unsustainable developmental and unfair competition within european eu ...
prime , degree flexibility be maintain for business and for authority accountable for subsidy exemption ...
installation which come under remit this directive must be authorise ...
i think that this directive should be link to european eu poss industrial political ...
pl mr president , i would love to comment on two matter ...
second matter concern member state with coal basis industry and draft directive ...
transitional duration for large combustion plant concern so2 and nox emission be particularly important to we ...
i would love to congratulate all negotiator ...
we need control reduction surplus bureaucracy so that we can have more efficient activity ...
we need concrete and covenant guideline which establish eu wide minimum standard ...
we need accompany increase in efficiency in order to be able to protect we environment more effectively ...
however , we also need independence and goal control body which will ensure adherence to new guideline ...
agricultural sector therefore have lead role to play in climate and environmental protection ...
industry can now follow ...
ro i approve compromise text result from trialogue ...
it will allow exemption to be agree from emission value accept and basis on better available technique ...
these exemption concern cases where investment cost outweigh environmental benefit ...
upshot all this ...
president cut off orator
it be pity , because it be hugely important directive for both air quality and eu industry ...
although we achieve sensible compromise , company must invest in cleaning technologies , which be not inevitably available ...
plant will have to be close prematurely and cost to consumer will be considerable ...
premature closure plant would represent cost that resultant environmental benefit would not cover ...
flexibility be yet possible but must now be clearly justified ...
commission can collect information on use this flexibility ...
you be probably aware that we proposal be for shorter time ...
i hope that i have already prove that in prime half my mandate ...
i think it be fair to say that we give industry time to build change into normal investment plan ...
that be what compromise be bring ...
fact be that we be move ...
it certainly have support commission ...
good omen , i think ...
who exactly it will be , we will see ...
i do not wanna to express any preferences now ...
chri davy , many acknowledgements !
that also do not happen every day ...
it be certainly value note ...
however , congratulation to we dutch friend , course ...
i wanna to talk about two aspect debate to which i have just be able to listen ...
prime be that i understand all worry and woe my eastern european friend only too well ...
as east german , i be also half eastern european ...
in order to get high level environmental protection , one have to be able to allow it ...
we must agreement with fact that industrial process in asia be always cheaper than here ...
those which do not do this will become less competitive ...
no one , includes this law , be demand that industrial enterprise should be switch off tomorrow ...
we have enough transitional duration , but to say that we must go without for competitive reason be fake ...
mr krahmer , congratulation on you splendid work ...
debate be close ...
voting will adopt place tomorrow , wed , 7 july 2010 , at 12 00 ...
write statement rule 149
at moment , we be witnesses tentative developmental alternative energy resource in certain region ...
this maintain considerable dependency on fossil fuel ...
we must find solution enable we to invest in state art energy output facility in least pollute way possible ...
industrial activity require high level environmental protection ...
this be particularly true for prevention air and water pollution , but also for biodiversity ...
main strategy emerge as result be to combat environmental pollution at source ...
it be also application to support and monitor member state in implementation measure ...
in this regard , co-operation with european confederation industry , sme and ngos play important role ...
loss to industry may be as high as pln 50 billion ...
implementation directive will also have adverse effect on thousand poland business ...
this be four annum shorter than poland have expect ...
extend transitional duration would make technological conversion easier for small heating plant ...
in view above , recommendations for second reading industrial emission directive should be dismiss ...
obligation operator who place wood and wood product on market debate
these operator must be aware wood poss origin ...
parliament would have love ban on entire string , and not just prime seller ...
all party must therefore adopt responsibility for ensure that no illegal wood be sell in eu ...
most flagrant breach ban on sale illegal wood should be treat as crime ...
we consider sort context in which this notion occur in present legislation ...
illegal harvesting also destroy biodiversity ...
forest be vital importance in maintain biodiversity and in global climate and water cycle ...
nowhere be three pillar sustainable developmental clearer than in relation to forest ...
challenge stay as to how we detect unlawfully harvest wood ...
proposal in front you merit you support ...
it certainly have mine ...
however , i must say that we work well together ...
i would also love to thank spanish presidency ...
i have three thing in mind when work on this issue ...
firstly , that wood be wonderful and renewable material that we use too little rather than too far ...
we must not impose highest requirement on wood than we do on oil , for example ...
secondly , it must be possible to implementation legislation ...
export wood and wood product be important factor in swedish become rich once upon time ...
we must not prevent or country that be currently bad from export and trade ...
many my objection have be hear , for which i be very grateful ...
i think that we have achieve great agreement ...
i see many friend here who fight hard with we ...
this be absolutely absurd ...
however , this legislation protect european citizen and european producer from unfair competition from inexpensive illegal wood ...
it be also because nowadays we be send very strong signal to rest world ...
this be very important signal on part european eu , and should not be underestimate ...
deforestation both legal and , in particular , illegal stay major issue in world ...
fair be fair , however this signal be actually only effective acknowledgements to european parliament ...
as far as i be concern , this be great victory for democratic ...
unfortunately , if it be not implement effectively , it will be document tiger ...
this also go for shadow rapporteur ...
in my opinion , parliament have set example how it can operate and express its democratic power ...
i be very happy to have be part successful negotiation to secure agreement ...
it be possible to come to such agreement when we all work together ...
i would love to highlight one very welcome side effect ...
it follow on kindly from what jan be just say ...
mr president , commissioner , i would also love to begin by thank rapporteur this splendid work ...
we be therefore also talk about transfer wealth from producer to country consuming this wood ...
this illegal practice place sustainable wood exploitation and company involve in it at risk ...
beautiful sound word be not enough ...
this report adopt very important step in this directorate by define prohibition on wood trade ...
good intention be not enough either ...
effective means be need , particularly penalty , which ca be three type in this cases ...
however , how far back should we trace wood , and which product be it realistic to check ?
i be think about furniture consist mdf and chipboard that be make recycling wood , for example ...
i hope that , with this proposal , we will be able to prevent that from happen ...
i hope that commission will put forward proposal relate to this as soon as possible ...
it be important for we citizen , judge by my postbag and number e mail i have receive ...
civil war in liberium , mainly fund through illegal log , kill 250 000 persons ...
human rights watch say that usd two billion have be lose in tax revenue in indonesium ...
so what we be do nowadays be prime step ...
i would love to thank commissioner for go further than he predecessor ...
tomorrow , we will make start ...
he be sympatic , but he service and lawyer say it ca not be do ...
it can be do , and here we have proof it ...
this be splendid , this be good news and important measure ...
what do that mean ?
one see wordseffective , proportionate , dissuasivetime and time again ...
i would love you to be prime commissioner to actually ensure that those word have proper effect ...
de mr president , i think that we be make good legislation nowadays ...
it would be far too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence origin throughout entire supply string within europe ...
this be on table at begin debate ...
therefore , we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance ...
we have succeed in do this ...
this be not only applicable to fall , and it will not work ...
scratch risk be not feasible ...
it produce bureaucracy and , above all , produce new risk ...
in this sense , this compromise be good one ...
i be happy that we will be able to approve it with large majority tomorrow ...
we be surely all unanimously on that issue ...
that should not be purpose at all ...
that , too , be now something to make we apprehensive ...
this be important example how we should not work ...
we have quite bit to do in this area in future ...
we must attempt to avoid sort issue that we have in connection with this issue in particular ...
this be why it be imperative for europe to improve legislative framework in this area ...
however , it be not perfect solution ...
there be option for by-pass even this system ...
however , further measure be ...
president cut off orator
after all , 20 % to 40 % worldwide industrial wood output come from illegal source ...

impact regulation depend on effective implementation , and challenge be far from over ...
we be clearly agreement with proposal noble character ...
i be look forward to engage in implementation and implementation process together with you ...
i be glad that we have make possible what he think impossible at time ...
many have be and be concern about bureaucracy ...
company should have document need for this in any cases ...

we need to clean up european wood market as soon as possible ...
while it ca yet be improve , propose regulation be ambitious and courageous ...
regulation establish mandatory provision which delegate responsibility on basis due diligence system ...
in many cases , we see illegal mining even in european eu country ...
this be link to management animal , especially shop one ...
it be appropriate to resolve these question at corresponding domestic or region level ...
confederal group european unite leave nordic green left will certainly support rapporteur poss proposal ...
unlawfully harvest wood and wood product have no place on we market ...
this be also human rights issue ...
last week , dutch television show how we energy company profit from coal mining in south african ...
spokespeople these company be turn blind eye they lack courage to be publicly accountable ...

i believe this to be extremely positive details ...
what be cap for ?
why be it yet relevant in 21st xxi ?
that be scale challenge ...
that would help to create work and provide real opportunity for farmers to diversify and earn additional income ...
it can not be right and justified to continue make payments basis on how you farm some 10 annum ago ...
we also have to tackle issue market volatility , but on this i would urge some caution ...
yes , we yet need interference and private aid to storage ...
yes , we need to consider other tool such as risk insurance and future market ...
yes , we need we particular reservation budgetary line to fund action in mandate crises ...
that have already be attempt and it have fail ...
i would suggest that we do not wish to go down that road again ...
as far as cross compliance be concern , i think that it have have positive impact on directly payments ...
it have also clearly define start item public products rightly remunerate from public purse ...
course , we can simplifying cross compliance measure ...
as far as we group be concern , this report convey aspiration for european agriculture ...
agriculture must be support in this evolution ...
issue generational change will be one we concern ...

let we not see agriculture as environmental villain and environmental issue ...
agriculture and forestry hold fundamental solution to we enormous issue ...
previous cap reform have lead to liberalisation agricultural market ...
they have give rise to profound injustice in distribution aid between country , product and producer ...
it be also essential that we maintain second pillar common agricultural political ...
mr president , i would love to thank rapporteur for this report ...
future farming and cap must provide farmers with viable secure income ...
pillar one paymentss must continue give farmers directly paymentss which give they minimum level income security ...
distribution cap fund must adopt into consideration cost output in member state ...
this be good thing ...
primary function agriculture be and stay output foods for we citizen ...
farmers be require to produce more and more with less and less ...
this be impossible without increase efficiency ...
european parliament , commission and council be accountable for secure necessary framework condition for this ...
everything else be very worthy , very desirable , but secondary ...
we must face up to this issue and solve it ...
we can not continue with such great difference in lengthy mandate ...
solve this issue be go to be difficult ...
i would love to thank mr smith , who have notice issue with budgetary ...
it be necessary to amend cap to help those who need it urgently ...
currently largest percentage go to big owner and to producer ...
proper budgetary for cap be also important , and i express my acknowledgements to mr lyon ...
these system can operate and become widespread throughout european eu ...
commission must commit itself to define budgetary that be sufficient to achieve these goal ...
what be more , at this time crises , many young persons wanna to return to farming ...
i believe that commission must adopt supportive and flexible approach to help young farmers ...
president cut off orator
i wish to stress in particular article refer to common agricultural political poss architecture ...
cap must continue to be basis on its two pillar ...
other key item be to maintain cap budgetary at least at its present level ...
however , farmers need support to be able to comply with these standard ...
well structure , properly finance common agricultural political mean safe , good quality foods for european ...
mr president , i too wish to thank my fellow george lyon for he splendid work on this report ...
common agricultural political must stay common european political ...
secondly transparency and proportionality should be central to future cap ...
lastly , european farmers produce foods to higher quality and standard ...
we also need to ensure level play field , fair competition and future viability european agriculture ...
bulgarian and romanian will receive mere 40 % ...
at same time , all be operate in common market european eu ...
i firmly believe that this injustice must be eliminate as soon as possible ...
all farmers throughout eu must have equality position and same condition for subsidy ...
in 1970 , nearly 70 % eu budgetary be spend on agriculture ...
unfortunately , nowadays revise cap be be design under same condition competitiveness as previous political ...
it be insulting that economic crises be be use as excuse to cut benefit to farmers ...
moreover , it be latter who be to blame for nowadays poss condition crises ...
mr president , i declare interest as work farmers ...
plan for future cap have to work at practical level and it must be affordable ...
if there have to be cap , let it assist farmers and not hinder they ...
fr mr president , i understand that you have short and happy evening ...
what be aim here ?
that be aim ...
what do we mean by that ?
dismiss renationalisation cap and increase cofinancing , that be prime item ...
4th element be regulate and prevent market volatility , which i believe be essential ...
we must return to this topic and we need to go little further yet ...
my final item concern prime and second pillar ...
i be say that this morning because this be debate we be hold ...
commissioner , i would love to finish with simple idea ...
cap be create at same time as european economic community ...
we be now in european eu ...
i really feel that we ought to have major political ...
president cut off orator
finally , it need to deliver value for money ...
to my mind , that mean we should ensure that fund be use effectively ...
rapporteur have produce splendid report ...
i congratulate he on he work and be happy to support ...
farmers will be pay per hectare for water conservation , thereforestation and so forth ...
choice without alternative be no choice at all ...
wale have strong history agriculture and many community depend heavily upon farming ...
its market orientation will continue as at present ...
we need proper safety net ...
commissioner , we farmers will once more have to make effort to adapting ...
any change that do adopt place must be accompany by realistic transitional duration ...
i would love to thank mr lyon and all shadow rapporteur for they work ...
as you know , rule procedure make provision for five to speak ...
in accept new challenge , common agricultural political must maintain its care for environmental value and foods security ...
in addition , i propose leave attempt and testing instrument for market regulation untouch ...
milk quota be example ...
if they be end , what will we replace they with ?
course , there be certain idea , but we do not have any security ...
president cut off orator
president cut off orator
evidence be that , nowadays , europe be net importer agricultural raw material ...
furthermore , nowadays we have cap that must be reform for three reason ...
it be cap that be unfair , economically , socially and environmentally ...
socially aid be unfairly distribute between country , region and farmers ...
80 per % aid be allocate to 20 % farmers ...
environmentally we need cap which respect soil , which respect ...
president cut off orator
that therefore mean that cap require in-depth reform and such reform require start from scratch ...
yet we farmers be not always reward by market for these contribution to public good ...
we therefore need support where market fail ...
fact that report call for aid per hectare be positive thing ...
this will counteract further intensification agriculture and make achievement environmental target more realistic perspective ...
that be how we can reward we farmers ...
de mr president , lady and gentleman , agricultural political need coherent framework ...
this must strengn eu as whole , while also adopt region difference into account ...
there be some enormous challenge face agricultural political ...
i would therefore welcome clear signal on that from commissioner as soon as possible ...
new public mechanism for regulate agricultural output will have to be establish to ensure foods security consumer ...
we be in favor strong cap that have budgetary it need to achieve its goal ...
president cut off orator

i have two application to speak in relation to observance rule procedure ...
mr mcguinness have floor prime ...
i will put in write statement on this issue ...
i hope you support my item , fellow ...
those be rule procedure ...
moreover , it be prescribe that five shall speak , although we have give 10 floor ...
this be very important issue ...
now mr obermayr have floor , also in relation to observance rule procedure ...
de mr president , i assume you be refer to i ...
course i would love to thank you for you generosity in allow ten orator rather than five ...
we understand you time constraint , naturally , but i hope you will understand we too ...
this be very important issue ...
there be part europe that be operate under considerable burden and that be under extreme threat ...
naturally this be also true beyond work committee ...
secondly , you indicate that issue regard catch eyeprocedure have not be resolve ...
it would be helpful and fair to put appropriate structure in place as soon as possible ...
i beg you indulgence and thank you again for you understanding ...
you be absolutely right ...
however , there be member here who be constantly get blue card out ...
however , i do not wish to prolong debate ...
i therefore feel that we need realistic budgetary ...
what we notice be that we be demand more and more we farmers ...
we must reflect on how agriculture and agr i foods sector can contribute to this ...
i also wanna to send out clear message and to answer mr kelly poss question about directly aid ...
therefore , in my opinion , historic reference do not represent fair , transparent or goal criterion ...
to conclude , i would love to reaffirm that we need common agricultural political for europe ...
new strategic importance for foods output and cap absolutely ...
two pillar absolutely , i agree with that ...
foods output at heart cap yes , that be absolutely what cap be about ...
it need to be goal and transparent as to how money be allocate between member state ...
they need to meet challenge europe 2020 strategy ...
applause
debate be close ...
voting will adopt place nowadays , thursday 8 july 2010 , at 12...00 ...
as mr mcguinness say , they may present they contribution in write ...
effort need to be make towards rigor , but it need to be make by all we ...
write statement rule 149
adapting cap to new social and economic reality be necessary step ...
we actually need to answer some key question to be able to do this ...
i totally concur with need to guarantee security foods supply ...
until now , cap have keep price high for foods which be cheaper in other country ...
eu can not promote free trade while protect its own agricultural market ...
however , i be concerned most about impact which cap reform have have on farmers ...
decouple be necessary to avoid overproduction ...
we need incentive for farmers , especially to encourage young persons to move to rural area ...
however , this be not go to happen while maintain present directly payments system , which be ludicrous ...
above all , eu need to retain trust european farmers ...
europe will yet need effective and common agricultural political after 20thi be why eu poss agricultural budgetary should at least be maintain at present level ...
europe have particular responsibility to guarantee foods safety in world ...
therefore , main task cap be to preserving agricultural output capacity european eu ...
it be therefore vital to ensure that directly payments do not decline ...
these would reduce farmersloss arise from price fluctuation ...
european foodss trade be far more concentrated than foodss treatment industry or agricultural output ...
this be why we must help improve co-operation between farmers ...
however , this require exemption from stringent eu competition rule in agriculture ...
i would love to thank all those involve for work they have do ...
forward look target have be formulate for entire community ...
attempt and testing two pillar structure must be retain with strong prime pillar and equally strong second pillar ...
major fluctuation in liberalise market and effect climate change continue to necessitate safety net ...
we thus provide for opportunity transitional duration ...
such duration be essential , but full seven annum would be excessively lengthy transitional duration ...
undistorted competition in europe be also precondition for competitiveness european farmers in world market ...
future common agricultural political after 2013 be extremely important for we ...
entire european parliament need to be aware cap poss significance for future eu ...
nowadays , difference between level payments in different member state be too great ...
this undermine sense solidarity , equality and community ...
what farmers need most all be stable income , both now and in longer mandate ...
thank you very far ...
report be firm on keep political eu one , dismiss attempt to there nationalise it ...
to begin with i wanna to thank my fellow mr lyon for draft very balanced report ...
i believe that this have already allow we to create good basis for debate for near future ...
change agricultural political be perhaps one largest task this plenary session ...
report be good basis for further debate ...
thank you for you care ...
de i thank rapporteur ...
we primary goal must be to ensure high quality foods output in europe ...
in debate on organization agrarian reform , there be recurrent talk compensation public products ...
in my opinion , this debate go in right directorate ...
developmental rural area play ever greater role ...
however , european eu recently win 12 new member state ...
however , this can only be achieve if resource dedicate to agricultural political be not reduce after 20 i believe that only major reform can save common agricultural political ...
directly payments significantly affect security foods supplies ...
next item be debate on
i be one complainant prime oral question ...
i be not at all happy that we now have joint debate with two question merge ...
i have attempt since may to get mercosur question on agenda ...
i do not know how this happen or why this happen ...
i be extremely unhappy about it ...
can i come back to this in debate ?
i would love clarification please , and i hope other fellow will support i ...
clearly there be not enough time this morning ...
you see demand and you see issue ...
can we get this parliament to work for member parliament , not for administration parliament ?
president cut off orator
it be not administration that organise debate ...
administration help political body organise debate ...
mr president , it be not because it be summertime and we be all cross ...
it be just because we make very valid item and we adopt we work severely ...
i be go to adopt 30 seconds because i have two blank page ...
i have ask five question commission ...
i do not intent to speak before i hear answer ...
i will return at end debate ...
thank you very far , mr mcguinness ...
i will subsidy you later time that you have not use now ...
by same token , ear tag rule be not implement ...
these be only some example many i ca list from fao report last october ...
indeed , it will have entirely contrary effect ...
we can not accept this ...
europe buy 38 millions tonne soya and feed for cattle ...
these import from brazil and argentina monopolise more than 19 millions hectare ...
they be concentrate in hand three enterprise cargill , adm and bunch ...
between 2001 and 2004 soya destroy more than 1...2 millions hectare equatorial and equatorial forest ...
it be one principal cause increase in greenhouse gas emission and loss biodiversity ...
this decision be motivate by need to have environmentally friendly agriculture and to combat climate change ...
these effort will be completely undo by this draft bilateral agreement ...
these concession will not serve interest farming family mercosur , only those agro industrial group ...
many poultry farmers , particularly in brittany , pay price for that agreement ...
europe seem to wanna to pursue its political relocation by intensify its assault against farmers ...
we must stop this crazy process by offer we citizen quality , locally produce foods ...
mr president , i will attempt and be brief ...
there be real concern about reopen negotiation with mercosur ...
i represent scotland , which have extensive beef output ...
secondly , what negotiate mandate will negotiator have in mandate agricultural product ?
can someone please tell i what they be be allow to negotiate on ?
how many tonne beef ?
how far access ?
be there no tariff , or be there minimum tariff ?
can someone please tell we what mandate be ?
two other item ...
two be completely link and therefore we need to understand what impact will be ...
finally , what involvement do agriculture commissioner have on this issue ?
will this parliament be consult before any final agreement be reach ?
i would love to hear some answer to these question ...
we share common history and social value with they ...
deepen political and cultural tie and maximize mutual benefit in economic mandate therefore make perfect sense ...
agriculture be only one part this macro agreement ...
fear therefore need to be face in mandate they proper percentage and justification ...
i be thus happy to respond in any format decide by presidency ...
in economic mandate , successful agreement ca bring considerable benefit to both eu and mercosur ...
it be increasingly important partner for eu ...
in mandate external directly investment , mercosur be also key partner ...
commission have adopt this decision after in-depth examination and in depth internal debate ...
this be proper decision college , and parliament be extensively inform immediately afterwards ...
that be something quite different ...
prime sitting with mercosur adopt place last week in bueno aire ...
we will course keep european parliament and council fully inform about evolution negotiation ...
this apply to all area to be cover by agreement , includes agriculture ...
in this context , we be aware that accompany measure might become necessary for most sensitive sector ...
it be , however , way too early to discuss what these measure ca cover ...
we be only just start negotiation and have not yet enter into debate on substance ...
it be not trade commissioner who decide what agricultural offer will be put on table ...
be fully includes in these debate ... so mr dacian ciolo ?
i believe that if we make right choice it be possible to successfully conclude both negotiation ...
as regard foodss safety , it go without say that import have to fully respect eu foodss safety requirement ...
eu approach in all trade negotiation be certainly not to decline eu level protection ...
now let i turn to eu brazil summit and start with short overview we relation ...
moreover , brazil often act as informal jumper between western and emerge and development country ...
brazil be one nine country with which eu have enter into strategic partnership ...
moment for such assessment be particularly appropriate as president lulum poss mandate in office approach its end ...
at summit we will confirm we commitment to strengn non proliferation and encourage closer co-operation ...
brazil oppose iran sanction adopt last june by un security council ...
summit will also tackle region issue cuba , hondura , paraguay and venezuelum ...
lastly , tough work be yet be finalize on some issue where we expect summit to deliver ...
prime , signature horizontal civil aviation agreement and air safety agreement ...
second , announcement joint work program on triangular co-operation with development country ...
i will attempt to give extra example in response to you question ...
brief digression commissioner , negotiation with country ande and central america have be complete ...
do agreement includes net exporter clause , in order to prevent developmental trade triangle ?
can commission assure we that import price will be maintain in fruits and vegetable sector ?
brazil be only bric country with which europe have no strategic partnership ...
beef import will increase by 70 % , poultry import by 25 % ...
commissioner , i would therefore love to voice my concern to you ...
we agriculture be in great difficulty ...
destabilise it further will have serious consequence ...
we can not development european trade political without adopt account and defend one we main asset ...
commission must hear this message and this demand ...
my group and i share these concern ...
that be why impact assessment be absolutely essential ...
clearly there be lack consistency here ...
nor must we lose sight misgiving agricultural sector in relation to inexpensive meat import ...
e mr president , we be all happy about free political prisoners in cuba ...
with regard to subject mercosur , there be several clarification that need to be make ...
i do not understand why certain sector or interest group should come out this negotiation at disadvantage ...
it will depend on firmness we negotiator ...
disastrous toc on effect might also follow for other sector , such as pork sector for example ...
commissioner , i would ask you to be particularly vigilant in this regard ...
this be not scaremonger ...
european farmers be operate under strict health and safety criterion ...
they adhere to all standard set for they and they guarantee high quality , safe produce for consumer ...
i agree that we must improve coordination all these topic within european parliament ...
i should love to emphasise one item in particular ...
i be actually grateful that commission have reopen negotiation ...
on 5 may this annum , this house support reopen negotiation in salafranca report ...
in other word , commission be do exactly what parliament decide by large majority ...
noneless , i would argue that we do not wanna agreement at any price ...
naturally interest agriculture , industry and service sector must be adopt into account as whole ...
however , commissioner , this trade with mercosur country should not be allow to become one way street ...
recurrent claim make in public that europe be close itself off in agricultural market be quite bad ...
we purchase over 90 % african agricultural export and 45 % central and south u...s... agricultural export ...
europe be certainly not close off to external trade ...
what i would criticise , commissioner , be information political pursue ...
it have not be good ...
as agricultural policymaker , i prime learning that these negotiation have begin when i open newspaper ...
in future we should not have to rely on press for we information ...
i urge you to inform agricultural sector represent here in parliament about progress negotiation ...
last annum , parliament pass most stringent plant protection product legislation in world ...
many active ingredient be prohibit in europe ...
consumer protection be inviolable and we would do well to remember this in negotiation ...
you be not tell truth !
this be truth , mr de gucht ...
this be other reason for my question ...
incidentally , i would add that new member state can only lose out here ...
they should sort it out themselves ...
there be no need to provide eu framework for this ...
hu european commission define negotiate mandate some 11 annum ago ...
world have change over past 11 annum ...
european commission have disregard these developmental ...
it have not application new mandate ...
without proper mandate , we can only reach intolerable agreement ...
go back to draw board ...
last orator tackle some item that i would wish to make ...
contrast that to delight , or rather to fear and trepidation and anger , among eu producer ...
this parliament impose high standard foods output on we producer ...
we have fail to defend they in past ...
there be no consistency between agriculture and trade political ...
this parliament have to stress that there will be ...
that be precisely issue be discuss behind scene at negotiation with mercosur ...
where , i ask , be consistency ?
already we be talk about possible concession on agriculture , and i would love you to clarify this ...
in you response you speak about forthcoming summit on climate change ...
i come from ireland , and we export 90 % we beef ...
recent search have show that brazil emission be between three and eight time highest than irish equivalent ...
will any this be adopt into consideration in you impact assessment ?
it mr president , lady and gentleman , spanish presidency have decide to sign this agreement ...
i therefore call on commission to adopt authoritative position so as to safeguard european quality output ...
sacrifice agriculture for win in other area be simply intolerable ...
beef industry in unite kingdom be currently experience fall in farm gate price ...
how be europe go to provide for these persons ?
commission that claim to act in better interest citizen must do so ...
we must end these talk and look after we farmers ...
pl negotiation with mercosur country be suspend in 200however , we should also be protect interest we farmers and agriculture and foods sector ...
if that happen , it would be necessary to propose certain form compensation to farmers ...
expert estimation that make such agreement ca result in very large loss income among farmers ...
these will be even highest if agreement be both bilateral and make at wto level ...
however , when i consider we agricultural output and product themselves , not everything can be prove scientifically ...
in europe we have some splendid legislation in relation to future biodiversity ...
political must be able to decide , even when scientific evidence be unavailable ...
we do not wanna clone meat from mercosur country ...
you understand that we feel that mandate be no longer valid ...
i would also love to draw you care to political aspect mercosur ...
in trade , key element be trust ...
mercosur be almost dissolve at 2007 summit ...
country do not agree on accession ...
venezuelum almost do not accede ...
how can we negotiate in such politically unstable area ?
prime check political stability mercosur and then we will conclude trade agreement ...
de mr president , i believe that we have talk great agreement about sustainability ...
i think this be outrage ...
please tell we when you be go to ignore persons ...
fellow , by way explanation , i have about 18 persons on list ...
nowadays i adopt eight orator ...
so i think i have do maximum i ca have do ...
prime all on mandate ...
several member criticise fact that we be work on basis mandate go back to 199thi apply to all area to be cover by agreement , includes agriculture ...
that be yet true ...
that be yet what we have to do , so nothing far have to be add to this mandate ...
in mean time , we have issue climate change and world have change since then ...
yes , we have notice that too , and we will adopt this into consideration in negotiation ...
that be not reason to change mandate ...
there be other member who say that council should be here and that council should instruct we ...
council do not have to instruct we ...
we be not instruct by council ...
we will stick to that ...
i be ready to discuss at length any element ...
i have do so with adopt committee and i be ready to go back to adopt committee ...
letter be send by director general for trade to he argentinean counterpart on 12 may ...
we message be very strong and very clear ...
we will stress that we have this sitting as soon as possible ...
on sugar
analogous quota be provide for within framework negotiation with central america ...
colombian , peruvian and central u...s... aggregated quantity account for less than two % european consumption ...
as for plant health , environmental and other measure ...
but those be not one that we can impose on other country ...
i presume that this be not last time we will discuss mercosur in this plenary ...
commissioner , i be also sure that this will not be last time we do so ...
joint debate be close ...
reopen negotiation with mercosur country without consult member state be very filthy play ...
otherwise , cost concession under wto will be bear by we farmers ...
these mercosor talk represent potentially dreadful developmental for future european agriculture ...
i have to say that commission poss attitude to matter have be appalling ...
this attitude , i find , be appalling ...
it be hearten to see so many agricultural pem here from all group support protection agriculture ...
it seem that mercosur negotiation be only pursue one goal to hand over defenceless european agriculture ...
sensitive agricultural sector must not be hand over in negotiation ...
feel free to sell you grandmor , commissioner , but do not give away we european agriculture ...
two commissioner for one report , what honor !
import fishery and aquaculture product from third country account for more than 60 % eu consumption ...
lady and gentleman , survival european fishery be non negotiable ...
in essence , we be demand follow ...
this will mean that better account be adopt specific characteristic fishery and aquaculture product ...
i think this be perfect time to review mandate this fundamental debate ...
indeed , we be on eve important reform pcp ...
we have fishery sector that be neither environmentally sustainable nor economically perform well ...
so here we need answer ...
i strongly support you call for increase consistency we political ...
we need to work together with global and integrate vision ...
with reference to wto negotiation , we be pay particular care to ongoing debate on subsidy ...
this bring we to tag ...
consumer wanna to know more about seafood they buy ...
commission be ready to work on legislative initiative aim at give consumer information they need ...
finally , word on aquaculture ...
this sensitivity be adopt into consideration in implementation common commercial political ...
i will be very honest with you on this item ...
we therefore actively defend far stronger integration social and environmental criterion into trade agreement regard fishery product ...
however , we must be clear ...
for these reason my group will clearly voting in favor report ...
moreover , i would love to congratulate mr cadec on splendid work that he have do ...
they enter european market at price that be uneconomic for european producer ...
europe poss own catch have diminish at worrying rate by 26 % since 1997 alone ...
this should not need to be cases ...
cadec report mention several important instrument that eu can use ...
prime be inn regulation ...
that be prime step , but it do not go far enough ...
second instrument be already in place in unite nation ...
we have good international agreement , but we also need to implementation they ...
we must continue to pursue this ...
mr president , commissioner , prime all i wanna to thank rapporteur for he report ...
value nethrop or langoustine sell by my fisherman in norrn ireland to other part europe plummet ...
this at same time as import shellfish and fish have become increasingly available ...
europe need fish ...
we need fish import , but i would contend that these should not come at any cost ...
on one hand , my fellow wanna to stop we fisherman receive any subsidy ...
europe can not have it both way ...
be it you responsibility to prevent this ?
it would not happen in any other parliament in world ...
applause
mr hager , we have to carry on ...
de mr president , mr damanak i , european fishery political be face enormous challenge ...
do both these thing at same time will place too high burden on we fisherman ...
better way to increase competitiveness be to allow fish stock to recover ...
other way to enable european fishery to survive would be through better marketing ...
i would also love to thank he for he splendid co-operation ...
there be major challenge involve in regulate import fishery and aquaculture product into eu ...
this market be grow rapidly and be increasingly dependent on import from third country ...
we have now submit two amendments in plenary ...
these relate to need for we to recognize particular economic situation in peripheral region europe ...
however , we do not hold market liberalisation alone accountable for difficulty ...
president cut off orator
without be protectionist , line defend here may be describe as less na?ve ...
that be why i favor european tag , in accordance with we standard , both environmental and social ...
we be tell originally that there would be voting at 12...00 ...
this have move by five minutess every five minutess ...
persons have plane to catch it be inconvenient it make mockery parliament ...
someone get grip !
applause
i would love to say that we be adopt care all concern mention by member ...
as mr de gucht and i have already mention , we be attempt to find balance ...
we need viable fishery sector and we have some obligation to wto and other international body ...

in this respect it need to be very clear ...
mr president , there be always delicate balance to be draw between civil freedom and security ...

eeas should build on value and identity european eu ...
president cut off orator
despite that , i do have few question and concern regard this new service ...
clearly , high representative need resource ...
in this way we ca ensure that service operate in more fair fashion ...
human rights have to be she top concern ...
european eu poss diplomatic body have already squeeze out domestic service ...
what be it do ?
i think we ca just about managing to do better ...
we be 4th largest military power on planet and fifth largest economy ...
i think we can run we own external political to suit we own interest !

kosovo can be consider last piece in complex balkan political puzzle ...
independent kosovo have already be recognize by 69 country , includes 22 eu member state ...
that be crucial item ...
most member state have now do this ...
i be early supporter kosovan independent ...
there be conflict between supranationalism and democratic ...
we should recognize it ...
 albania be certainly country which have make tangible progress in context reform process ...
political crises follow june 2009 parliamentary elections be regrettable ...
de mr president , ex communist socialist in albania be attempt to destabilise successful government there ...
this be not cases , and i also say this to mr f?le yesterday ...
eu commissioner must not be abuse for purpose socialist propaganda and for internal political end ...
macedonian government have democratic legitimacy ...
it do prime class work and it be put country on path towards european eu composition ...
aid to kyrgyzstan should be target at persons and not at specific government ...
uzbekistan have different opinion in this question ...
as report indicate , several human rights activist have be arrest without due cause in kyrgyzstan ...
these fact must be bear in mind when evaluate european eu strategy towards exists political power in kyrgyzstan ...
those country also have significant influence in this region ...
that be why i support this report , since this investigation be desperately necessary ...

europe have duty to guarantee foods security for its citizen ...
europe must guarantee appropriate livelihood for rural community ...
we must produce and maintain healthy environment here ...
we farmers need fair salary ...
pl i endorse this report ...
this be not incompatible with free market principle ...

in summary , we should aim for sustainable developmental agriculture and rural area ...
lv thank you , mr president ...
it stress that finance for political must be preserving for at least next lengthy mandate finance duration ...
secondly , it require that directly payments to farmers be fully finance from european eu budgetary ...
these destructive discrepancy distort competition and whole european eu market ...
f i mr president , i have to say that i voting in favor lyon report ...
on few item i have what i might call domestic reservation , or i voting bit differently ...
that be why i introduce few exemption when i voting ...
every member state need its own agriculture and have to ensure that it be preserving ...
mr president , i voting against lyon report because all over europe government be cut they budgetary ...
in unite kingdom nurse and teachers face cut in they pay and pension ...
police number be be cut and prisoners be be release because we can not allow to keep they in prison ...

write explanation voting
noterror agreementrespect grassroot freedom ...
nowadays , mandate this agreement have be considerably improve , in interest european citizen ...
agreement be significant step forward compare to previous version ...
give highly sensitive character personal datum transfer , i ca not voting for this agreement ...
agreement state that europe will development its own system for collection and sort bank details ...
that will offer opportunity to individualise transfer ...
from that moment on , issue reciprocity will become relevant ...
europol will be charge with task verify and approve we application ...
new agreement strike balance between protect privacy and guarantee security ...
in meantime , fight against terrorism will stay we override concern ...
while this agreement be satisfying , certain item ca yet have be improve ...
confidential and private finance datum belong to individual and not to eu or european parliament ...
this be matter for domestic government to decide , and not for european parliament ...
this new agreement be better than previous one ...
this agreement , however , continue to allow mass transfer datum bulk datum ...
choice europol be bad ...
europol be neither judicial authority nor datum protection authority ...
pt fight against terrorism must be priority for european eu ...
i be therefore voting in favor measure propose in this report ...
acknowledgements to action mp and we group in particular , new version be draw up ...
it contain significant underlie improvement , such as elimination ofbulkda transfer ...
that be why i choose to voting in favor new agreement ...
few month ago prime version agreement be too vague and do not offer analogous guarantee ...
that be why we saidno ...
commission should carry out this task in assiduous and timely fashion ...
article 15 and 16 ensure that citizen have strengn access to redress and increase transparency ...
new version be improvement on last one ...
it be unfortunate that majority in parliament have now voting in favor this agreement ...
we rather support more secure society with broad democratic rights and freedom ...
combate terrorism must not become excuse for inadequate datum protection ...
these be serious infringement fundamental rights ...
however , european eu be not permit to unduly restrict exists fundamental rights ...
i therefore yet dismiss this swift agreement ...
nowadays , after careful consideration , i voting in favor revise swift agreement ...
this new version also bring improvement , in particular as regard purpose datum transfer ...
in view importance datum protection , spd delegation do not make its decision lightly ...
for we , top priority be limit transfer bulk datum ...
sepa datum be not cover by agreement most transfer be not affect at all ...
new agreement be victory for all european institution , and for we european parliament in particular ...
i voting against this report ...
it be tantamount to approval unite state interference in europe with complicity body such as swift ...
this report and agreement that it ratify be symbol this europe poss slavery by u...s... imperialism ...
all mechanism that help to discover possible assault be fundamental to this fight poss successful ...
project for solution approve nowadays be good start item for difficult negotiation ahead with we ...
de datum protection with swift agreement be simply sham ...
i voting in favor alvaro report because i consider it important to combat terrorism ...
terrorism be threat and as such must be combate ...
there hashing swift agreement do very little to change this situation ...
citizen would prime have to cope with cost institute legal proceedings in unite state !
what be prime celebrate as successful for european parliament in february have now become washout ...
even rapporteur admit that he be not totally satisfied ...
it do not provide any real , effective datum protection and should therefore be dismiss ...
agreement also mark new phase in parliament poss power , ensure european democratic monitoring international agreement ...
this commitment will in mid mandate ensure mandateination bulk datum transfer to we authority ...
i voting in favor new swift agreement at nowadays poss plenary european parliament ...
this be very important agreement which aim to stamp out terrorism and organise crime by combate illegal financing ...
it be important that this new agreement also safeguard respect for personal datum european citizen ...
new agreement refer to need to create european tftp terrorist finance tracking program ...
this be commitment which need to be implementation within five annum ...
this be not cases here ...
present agreement enable transfer banking datum , but introduce proper security and privacy safeguard ...
real change towards mandatory fundamental rights protection in fight against terrorism require greater courage and effort ...
terrorist act must be prevent and every terrorist act must be condemn in strongest possible mandate ...
on other hand , there be protection citizensright ...
citizensright be not foregone conclude we have fight for they ...
it be tool nato strategy and war ...
it will be tool for apply precedence community law over domestic law state ...
this compromise be subject extensive negotiation and it currently seem satisfying and balanced to i ...
it allow european parliament to reinforce its prerogative and preserving community method ...
in addition , latter poss budgetary will be subject to political control from parliament ...
my country have show its commitment to european crises management mission ...
european external action service eeas represent considerable progress in this respect ...
european interest original draft have be retain ...
i be confident that subsequent negotiation on establishment eeas will respect this balance ...
will member state no longer be free to define they own external political ?
it be not acceptable to sovereignty nation for european organization to scrutinise its external service ...
it be not business ep to do so ...
common external political and common economic political be necessary goal european integration process ...
i welcome brok report as amend ...
it be essential to resist proposal to subsume developmental political as part we external political ...
we need autonomous developmentalal service answerable to autonomous commissioner for developmentalal and humanitarian aid ...
we need ensure implementation be pursue in accordance with spirit and letter agreement ...
there stay element proposal that ca give rise to different interpretation ...
rule and practice govern language in this service will reveal measure its commitment to external communication ...
same thing have happen with regard to eu intelligence structure ...
we , as member european parliament strengn by treaty , can help with this ...
what have parliament managing to win in negotiation with high representative ?
furthermore , it will have effect strengn european parliament poss political and budgetary control power ...
i sincerely hope that better use will be make this service in interest european eu ...
latter will thus demonstrate genuine political consistency and will speak with one voice on international stage ...
it can only emerge greater from this , and its action will be more legitimate and effective ...
proposal make by baroness aston be intolerable ...
i shall voting against this text ...
nowadays poss voting lay foundation for strong diplomatic service at european eu level ...
moreover , at least 60 % staff this new service will be eu official ...
this report will ensure geographical balance as well as better consistency between different aspect eeas ...
it be not about duplicate diplomatic service within eu , but about strengn eu poss diplomatic service ...
this be chance for european eu but also for its member state ...
timely coordination different area eu external political by commission be clearly important ...
this includes , in particular , reference that be adopt in text nowadays ...
better service ca have be possible , though ...
we support compromise because parliament managing to improve m aston poss original proposal considerably ...
agreement be not impeccable , however ...
they must work together , create common esprit de body and overcome divisive competition ...
in any cases , these cost should be within sensible and comprehensible limit ...
in this regard , we must utilise synergy in order to achieve maximum quality and cost savings ...
kosovo be part very sensitive geographical zone , on which eu should maintain steady focus ...
it be without hesitation that i support this resolution , which tackle these important issue ...
resolution also call for even stronger presence eulex in kosovo ...
pt i voting against this resolution ...
pt kosovo have yet not receive unanimously appreciation by member state ...
kosovo yet have lengthy way to go ...
for these reason , i can not support mr lunacek poss motion for resolution ...
it have therefore have no real impact on situation in country so far ...
rampant , widespread corruption and smuggling weapon and drug sow unrest in region ...
it be strange that currency in this territory be euro ...
particularly as basic precondition for use common european currency have not even superficially be meet ...
this assault adopt place four day after explosion in mitrovica during serb demonstration ...
eu basically need to agreement with process establish democratic and reinforce stability in kosovo ...
five eu member state , includes france , have not recognize kosovo poss independent ...
consequently , it be intolerable to present report nowadays that defender integration kosovo into eu ...
i shall voting against this intolerable and provocative text ...
this be signal encouragement for government as well as citizen kosovo ...
with this resolution , parliament be in favor start talk on visa liberalisation as soon as possible ...
that be why it will need all we support ...
eu should continue its strategy expansion in gradual and strict manner ...
neverless , everyone know that road to join eu be demand one ...
condition govern entry to eu be clear and well know , and not always easy to fulfil ...
i hope that albania proceeds along its way towards eu in determine and unhesitating manner ...
it be out friendship for  albanian that i voting against this text ...
i voting against this text ...
it encourage developmental and use renewable energy , public transport and environmental legislation ...
this matter be entirely up to  albanian persons themselves ...
one these measure be to promote persons to persons contact through university exchange between pupil , student and scientist ...
we should , in principle , support visa exemption for country western balkan ...
however , precondition for this be that all condition lay down be fully meet ...
i voting in favor joint motion for resolution draft by various political group ...
instrument should therefore be introduce to help there establish security in kyrgyzstan ...

there be no doubt this measure be adopt to humiliate she and to frighten she ...
vez , judge afiun i must be free immediately ...
this would not only be fair on you part , but also notable humanitarian gesture ...
question certainly merit to be ask , as both mix be common in hardline system ...
what be issue at stake here ?
she be arrest follow this release and place in detention ...
it be true that she detention condition be absolutely terrible , love those in all venezuelan prison ...
however , we be not hold urgent debate on prison here ...

next item be debate on seven motion for resolution on north korea ...
it be also measure how serious situation be in kim jong il poss famished empire ...
we do not have name any dissident or activist in territory north korea ...
that information must be allow to percolate through to we ...
situation there be even incomparable with that in former ussr eu or ceausescu poss romania ...
various concrete recommendations to this effect may be find in parliament poss joint resolution ...
well do !
i also unreservedly support paragraph 14 resolution ...
madam president , officially north korea claim that it guarantee religion freedom to its population 24 millions ...
what evidence be there he crime 20 bible and 10 worship cassette ?
it would appear that this be thing that north korean authority literally fatally fear ...
i would love to focus on two thing ...
there be second item i would love to mention ...
it be ridiculously difficult to get out this country , to escape ...
that be important when we consider situation that these persons be in ...
what be currently happen here be appalling ...

recently we have be able to see sportsman from north korea play at fifa world cup ...
in follow match they do not do so well ...
why be i talk about this sport event ?
afterwards , player meet with repression , and they be hold in force labor camp ...
we be very worried about what be go to happen to these sportsman next ...
this be perhaps country love no other in world right now ...
this should be one future topic we debate with china when we have we bilateral dialogue ...
reportedly 80 % north korean in china end up as trafficking victim ...
woman be particularly vulnerable to prostitute , rape , arrange marriage and bride trafficker ...
china must change its law to protect victim trafficking instead return they to north korea ...
therefore i will not expand on what other fellow have say ...
question really be , what can we do about it ?
there be 24 millions persons in north korea who need we assistance ...
provision radio in country where there be no information be actually vital tool ...
finally , we should do we better to assist refugee ...
as other fellow have say , persons flee north korea and they be not give assistance they merit ...
unfortunately , thing be not as mr vigenin and mr martin have say ...
this be unfortunate , because it would seem that on this question we ought to be unite ...
i come from country which be rule by communism ...
this be something which we should guarantee ...
however , there have also be experience footballer be make personally accountable for defeat ...

also recent sink south korean naval vessel be undoubtedly deliberate assault by north ...
government persons poss republic korea deny existence issue human rights violation ...
this be , however , at complete variance with eye witnesses report refugee and defector ...
pl madam president , north korea and cuba be last remnant communism in world ...
dream many north korean be simply to flee they own country ...
however , living be better there than in north korea ...
ro human rights situation in north korea be give particularly grave cause for concern ...
leadership in this country ban any form political opposition , democratic elections , press and religion freedom ...
accord to report , more than 150 000 north korean continue to be hold in six labor camp ...
they be not give any type medical care and receive very little foods ...
torture and sentence in force labor camp , often because political view , be everyday occurrence there ...
how can we help korean in this situation ?
through active joint approach by great power ...
ro there be so many human rights violation in north korea that we can not list they all ...
majority those send to these camp be no longer release ...
if they have children , latter can spend they whole living in captivity ...
although perhaps unwillingly , western have rather often turn its care away from event on korean peninsula ...
therefore , we must talk specifically about crime which be be commit and renew we appeal ...
madam president , i would love to congratulate parliament for undertake this debate ...
we will continue to do so ...
these persons can not simply be regard aseconomic migrant ...
