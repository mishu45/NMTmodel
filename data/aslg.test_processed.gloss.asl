margin be very small .
treaty lisbon give new power to european union in area such as space policy .

we still need to find out more and more thoroughly about what we fix expenditure be .
this must still be follow by cost benefit analysis various policy implement .
we be commit to see that it be . .
however , these guideline be also very realistic first step .

firstly , concern structural fund approximately 35 % budget .
we be do only half as well as we do in 2000 200 current absorption rate in all fund be 14 % and it be 25 % before .
otherwise , we will have situation where money be not use .
on or hand , it could be reserve .
there be also question wher this money will be use or not .
in agriculture budget in 2009 , payment be eur 2 billion less for rural development than in 200lastly , regard seventh framework program .
so question be wher delivery will be satisfactory .
then we can plan budget accord to situation .
we have so many need in or area as well .
so be those reserve or not ?
indeed , those priority leave much to be desire .
in itself , this choice priority be something to be welcome .
one proposal , for example , be creation erasmus first job program .
problem be that in politics , devil be in detail .
what be we talk about when we talk about anerasmus first job ?
how be we to implement it ?

we shall therefore have to increase we cooperation if we be to combat terrorism more effectively .

hu new member state be now implement 2007 european union wine market organization .
this be contrary to eu regulation because this wine can belong to either one category or or .
slovak request be now no longer in community poss e bacchus database among protect designation origin .
commission have thus put end to this illegal situation , and i thank they for it .
for this reason , i ask commission to remedy this irregular situation .
meanwhile , how be corps european external action service be create ?
rapporteur have produce balanced proposal .
she have take into account reality situation and formulate sound target .
i hope that parliament will follow and support text and proposal before we .
i would like to speak for few more minute about cohesion policy .
cohesion policy be not form do goodism .
true , there be enormous gap between develop and underdeveloped region .
we seek to eliminate these difference , or at least to shrink they .
otherwise , there be no greater waste .
i hope that there will be progress in this regard .
committee on budget be very keen to see that we get value for we money .
thank you for you respectful attention .
initial report be perhaps understandably vague and general .
however , amendment at committee stage ensure we be now clear on what be important .
i be sure all member will take that point on board .
analysis europarl tv , to see if it be effective or not , be also welcome .
it should not be unilateral decision .
i hope tomorrow , colleague will support these and or amendment which be aim at improve guideline .
guideline for 2011 budget also include european parliament poss own budget .
nl mr president , we be live in financially and economically difficult time .
in addition , citizen have little confidence in european policy , and this concern i greatly .
i wish to present two proposal relate to examination next budget , therefore .
this be not case at present , which be not what i would call transparent .
mr president , my second point concern budget national information office european parliament .
i call on my fellow member to support these proposal .
this would demonstrate we desire for transparency and we intention not to give ourselves special treatment .
i have substantive question regard priority rapporteur give to youth .
as rule , social and youth affair can be handle very well by member state .
yet i would draw attention to one issue where eu support be truly indispensable .
report mention young people poss transition from education to labor market .
last month , on visit to bulgaria , i see truly inspiring example this .
i be count on you .
mr president , most important priority any budget should be only to spend you own money .
spend someone else poss without they permission be not budgeting , it be ft .
take that money , without democratic mandate , be not victimless crime .
we soldier be kill by taliban bomb because we can not afford blast proof vehicle .
thousand cancer victim be deny expensive life save drug .
there should be only one budget priority slash spending and stop rob britain .
to they , it be matter life or death .
we in parliament be not go to put pressure on he for time be .
as he know , we will be do that from september onward .
new challenge for 2011 budget arise every day .
i would like to comment briefly on both report .
drzejewska , who have produce excellent report . ?
firstly , we need to make it clear that climate change be still major priority .
in all or respects , however , we need to look for way to make savings and increase efficiency .
this be particularly relevant , as head 5 budget , for administration , be severely stretch .
we recently discuss new external action service , for example , which will certainly require extra resource .
we must focus on parliament poss core task and elsewhere employ great deal constraint .
parliament should be take lead .
we need to send clear message to we government on this and save 200 million year .
european external action service be something that i take particular interest in .
however , this be not yet include in budget that commissioner be soon to present .
however , question how much it will cost be key importance for we .
i be in favor we include this service within commission , as that be where it belong .
we can not have administration multiannual program outside commission .
we can not allow this under any circumstance .
for that reason , what be most interesting about this budget be what it do not include .
everything be account for , down to last cent .
this rail journey basis should be scrap , with focus put on airline ticket and fly time instead .
i would therefore like to ask specifically that we provide ourselves with appropriate means to enable we to work .
bureau should be so kind as not to trouble member on this account .
i have one further request .
de mr president , we need different eu and we also need different eu budget .
i think we need courage to make big decision .
we should certainly not get bog down in minute technical detail .
i would like to say three thing about eu budget .
current eu budget do not provide any realistic information on this .
my second point be about savings .
for example , we could shut down large number eu poss agency .
then there be second seat in strasbourg .
thirdly , how be money use ?
money should be give , or give back , to where it come from , namely taxpayer .
i think we need courage .
we would all do well to take note this .
time have come for decision about spend money from eu coffer to be make jointly .
however , time be also need for this mechanism to begin to work .
europe be still behind in technology race with usa , japan and or new world power .
however , this can , certainly , be change , but it require significant outlay .
invest in young people be invest in future .
young people with degree be increasingly affect by unemployment .
commitment to young people , innovation and science be key to make europe world leader once again .
support for small and medium size enterprise , mainly in weakest region , be also interesting .
we priority must be to preserve exist job and create new one .
i believe that european union must invest in intelligent and ambitious industrial policy .
medium and long term successful building strategy be important .
it need to be environmentally friendly , energy efficient and particularly cost effective .
even municipal politician like mayor , freddy thieleman , admit this .
young people must be support both at eu and national level .
however , it be also vitally important to increase funding for erasmus mundus grant .
job retention and creation should receive most attention .
yes , that be low level in 2009 20it should go at cruise speed by 2011 , as should anti crisis delivery .
but , course , this should come this year if external action service be to be operational .
let we hope also for fruitful conciliation 2011 figure .
i be very pleased and motivate by this .
as you know , year 2011 be fifth year multiannual financial framework .
fifth ought to be decidedly better . those four year .
many you say something which i agree with that young people be european union poss future .
they be in education today and they be look for work today .
young people be not only we future , they be we today .
we should keep remind ourselves this .
i would also like to say few word on this extend think about european union budget .
i would also like to say few word to summarise debate on european parliament budget .
once again , i would like to thank you for you attention .
write statement rule 149
this project will only have chance success if we provide necessary funding for it .
this include technological innovation , sustainable development , combate climate change and care for biodiversity .
support for development educational system , with assistance interdisciplinary investment , be also strongly justified .
money must be invest in enterprise which guarantee that graduate will find employment .
testing will also start in 2014 on safety life service and commercial service .
let i remind you that galileo be crucial to future high tech industry in europe .
it will create new market and enable europe to become global competitor in field technology .
circumstance in which 2010 and 2011 budget will be adopt be exceptional and pose particular challenge .
parliament must engage in open discussion about expenditure ceiling in head 5 for 20work on 2011 budget be under way .
budgetary priority must contain european union poss response to challenge global crisis .
europe 2020 strategy be , from this point view , very important factor .
request for defense parliamentary immunity see minute
debate product quality policy what strategy to follow ?
by support niche agriculture in these disadvantaged area , we will create economy and job there .
this last point be vitally important if we want to protect against counterfeiting we high quality product .
that be my intention , in any case .
it have be real pleasure work with he and with or spokespeople for parliamentary group .
have to say . what mr ciolos ?
we naturally hope he will listen to parliament poss voice , which will be reflect tomorrow in vote .
as you have all observed , competition can take many form on market .
before conclude , i shall take liberty make one final point , which concern label .
report have four , or rather five point for debate .
first , joint european union logo .
i therefore ask that we support specific eu logo .
second point be question place origin .
occasionally , this cause concern , most recently in case tokaj wine .
fourth element organic logo .
on this there be complete agreement .
i would like to return to original form mr scott? poss report .
there be much in it that be to be commend .
we can not support paragraph 19 , so calledwonky fruitparagraph .
it be surely decision for consumer .
i would also like to see some change in paragraph it have to resonate with consumer and give some sort return to farming community .
otherwise , it be worthless .
we have bring forward number point and i will focus on two they only .
i and or believe that we consumer want to know where they food come from .
so there be much in this report to like .
i would echo mr lyon poss comment on eu logo .
i think that be more to do with ambition this building rather than what we consumer want .
amendment be constructive i hope they will be successful and that colleague will support they tomorrow .
we must always strive to achieve maximum potential europe poss agri food industry .
this will ultimately serve to increase we competitiveness and strengn economy in rural area .
these instrument have prove popular with consumer and producer alike .
however , i agree with rapporteur that they management and application must be simplify .
also , if we be serious about they value abroad , we must ensure more protection from third country .
however , i must point out that there be some element this report which i do not support .
i be against introduction eu quality logo .
what i support be country origin label .
fact be these rule be dismantle by commission last year .
i wholeheartedly support this move and now we can let market set its own standard .
madam president , thank you for opportunity to speak on this very important point .
obviously , promotion and marketing will be hallmark success or failure such policy .
we must take firm action against potential counterfeiting product which be wrongly label .
i like many colleague in this chamber would be against eu logo .
i feel it would be largely meaningless and would not be helpful to consumer .
i come from norrn ireland , net exporter agricultural product .
therefore , i want any label system to create level play field .
i therefore consider mandatory quality label to be important opportunity for we farmer .
in order to guarantee this high quality standard , control and objective criterion be certainly need .
however , fact be that financial consideration on part consumer also have effect .
quality cost , and farmer need fair income .
we also need to raise general awareness consumer in this regard .
we need introduction regulate and protect designation for product from mountain area and from gmo free area .
however , we also need traditional speciality guaranteedandorganic farmingindication .
whatever happen , these must be retain .
we business need to gain market recognition distinctive and quality relate aspect associate with they product .
madam president , first , may i declare interest ?
i be egg producer .
regulation must be honestly implement to common standard .
that be essential .
eu inspire crisis will shortly hit uk egg industry .
only then can consumer make inform choice .
i believe that we take same approach to these quality product .
yes , they represent opportunity for we most fragile region .
management production rights be fundamental part quality production policy .
moreover , almost all we committee vote in favor amendment along these line .
let we together interpret this amendment as call to find new middle way .
now present we with good text .
do so quickly we have faith in you .
where product come from be important .
local speciality be immeasurable value .
region that i come from in finland produce delicious goat poss milk cheese .
i can recommend it to you all .
there be special product like this all over europe .
we have to ensure that they find they way onto market .
we be pleased to note fact that importance stimulate market demand have be emphasise .
large number sme , subcontractor and supplier be affect by financial crisis .
social europe assign same level importance to economic development and social development .
from 2012 we will have schengen airspace .
operation fab be main element in create single european sky .
first these be functional airspace block system coordinator .
european parliament also manage to have special attention focus on human factor .
new specification issue by easa must integrate with exist one .
in addition , opportunity have be give to mention derogation grant so far .
for this reason i should like to thank parliament for speed with which it have adopt this decision .
this have certainly be major commitment and one that , i repeat , constitute effective response .
to conclude , for first time every aspect entire aviation sector will be deal with .
this be therefore start new phase for aviation safety agency .
she want real single sky for benefit european citizen .
today we have be able to realize this reform .
main contribution committee on industry relate to financing .
this second package legislation will allow we to manage we airspace more efficiently in year to come .
this organization must be provide with staff and equipment it need in good time .
this be simply not true .
european sky consist patchwork 60 national control center .
this be twice as many as in usa , but with half amount air traffic .
in addition , military no fly zone prevent plane from fly in straight line from one airport to another .
when amount traffic double , safety risk increase fourfold .
this lead we in 2004 to initiate single european sky concept .
this make contribution to safety , to climate protection and to reduce cost air traffic .
together with harmonisation safety standard , this also constitute very beneficial step forward .
lv thank you , madam president .
i believe that we can now make significant progress in this area .
council have oppose this right until end .
now even sky be not limit .
this be all about eu flag wave .
it be not to satisfy public and have nothing to do with demand .
let we resurrect efficiency by allow supply to feed demand and allow innovation .
this be not business eu .
please vote against .
to conclude , i also welcome objective optimise airport management .
i would like to thank mr marinescu for he excellent report and commission for its initiative .
however , we should not only be concern about improve functionality here and now in current crisis .
we should also continue to focus on important issue from past .
these include passenger rights .
airline have blatantly exploit this in current situation crisis , plus bad winter wear condition .
they behavior have be shameless .
my next point concern liquid .
it do not make anyone safer .
it provide few people with employment in security check at airport .
we be wait impatiently for regulation to be abolish .
de madam president , it be not simply case nowadays that aircraft fly across national border .
it be essential that flight in europe should be better coordinate .
in addition , co2 emission be much too high and airline be subject to enormous cost .
all this will be change and improve by regulation which we will adopt tomorrow .
i think we have work together to achieve something very positive for people europe .
that be what we be here for .
i agree , and that be purpose we work .
there be , however , few area where i would seek little bit clarification .
that could be future stumble block which i hope could be clear up .
datum supply today by iata be worry .
its profit be set to drop by 12 % .
thus face with crisis this kind , we be however capable introduce cost cut standard .
we have raise problem during several meeting with competent transport minister .
i do not see significant progress be make by russia , but we shall persevere .
since there be no possibility include it , it be not include in legislative text .
face with this datum i have launch inquiry by directorate general for energy and transport .
definition to which he refer have be somewhat supersede by criterion list .
to conclude , i be grateful to you once again .
lack rule and existence weak rule have give rise to financial and economic crisis .
i thank you once again for you great commitment .
i be please to be able to take part in and share this important political moment with you .
ro just some brief reply .
on subject eurocontrol , reform process have start so that new responsibility can be receive .
i would also like to thank you for positive feedback you have give on my effort .
commissioner , i would like to congratulate you on this success .
i would like to thank commission poss team expert which work alongside we to produce this agreement .
i also thank french presidency and czech presidency for they effort , especially thierry boutsen and vera zazvorkova .
vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 25 march 2009 .
when create aviation policy , safety must always be we primary concern .
i commend aim this report to make aviation safer and more efficient for all involve .
development unify regulatory framework and implementation new technology will be expensive .
regional airport may find it very hard to sustain add cost update they system .
shannon airport in west ireland provide air traffic control for large area north atlantic .
in present economic environment it will not be easy to borrow for new equipment and training .
to pass these cost on to consumer may be case diminish return .
sit be suspend at 20.00 and resume at 21.00

interoperability mobile charger debate
technical reason for this difference there be none .
there be no technical reason .
this be great opportunity concern technical matter , but important one for european consumer .
nowadays , anyone who change they mobile phone generally need completely different charger .
even different model from same manufacturer do not use standardise charger .
this be not new issue .
mobile phone could overheat or even explode during charge process .
therefore , i have take specific step to encourage industry to bring standard charger onto market .
i be confident that industry will act quickly .
however , in we role as european institution we must stay on ball .
we should under no circumstance exclude possibility introduce legal regulation .
this be good , but it do not go far enough .
commission will not hesitate to make legislative proposal if industry do not introduce voluntary agreement .
if that should not be case , then legal intervention may also be require here .
this be good thing in economic crisis .
in addition , we should ask standard institute to produce proposal which will make this possible .
course , this be not as easy as it seem .
on one hand , we have connection between charger and mobile phone .
it will be straightforward to establish technical standard for this .
perhaps we could involve international organization for standardisation iso in order to find worldwide solution .
i think that we need above all common technical standard .
2012 be not far away .
even if set be different make and model , they can be charge simultaneously .
progress be be make .
in seventh framework program for research we have large sum money allocate .
that say , consumer must also have choice .
at moment , consumer buy new phone have no choice at all .
i therefore think that this be excellent solution .
if family go away for weekend , it might take 30 charger with it .
you then need to find specific charger specific make and model .
my compliment , again , commissioner .
you have to keep big stick in reserve , but preferably reach solution through coax and self regulation .
you have succeed in that , and you have my congratulation .
de madam president , i have further question for commissioner verheugen .
usb 2 port can transfer not only energy but also datum .
would this not be alternative solution ?
all my expert tell i that exist standard can be use for all hand hold device .
u . also my answer to mr ?
standard you be ask about be in fact already in existence .
my final remark be direct once again at mr r?big .
i think this be subject which could be take much further .
commission be already work on it and will report back to you on result .
common consular instruction biometric identifier and visa application debate
i have be negotiate with council for quite long time .
committee on civil liberty , justice and home affair adopt my report in november 200on fingerprinting commission propose to start fingerprinting child at six year old .
i think that be very important .
overall we have reasonable deal .
newly create rule require eu embassy and representation to take fingerprint and photo applicant in future .
this meet four objective .
secondly , it will prevent so call visa shopping .
thirdly , process apply for visa will be speed up .
unfortunately there be not majority in favor this in house .
latter will certainly benefit european public and will enable we to improve we relation with third country .
she be one few rapporteur for whom nothing be impossible .
you know that my group strongly oppose extensive introduction biometric .
neverless , decision have be already adopt .
now , for we , it be crucial to obtain as many safeguard as possible .
here baroness ludford have do excellent job .
however , we have many concern .
we also oppose charge additional service fee .
however , this do not prejudice we position on lax report on visa code .
political discussion about wher babiesand small child poss fingerprint be really need be not yet over .
regulation on outsourcing also cause i some concern .
strict , standardise regulation be certainly need , as some member state be already use external service provider .
i do not believe that compromise agree with council in this respect be adequate .
unfortunately , council have ignore these concern .
further problem be service charge involve in outsourcing .
i believe it be wrong to pass this charge on to applicant .
however , in my opinion , higher charge would immediately cancel out this benefit .
i would like to thank everyone for they work on this dossier over recent year .
since 1997 , about 6 million migrant have enter uk .
about 4 million have leave , leave net population increase over 2 million .
this be equivalent to new city size birmingham .
most these migrant enter legally , because they be eu citizen .
in addition to that , we probably have one million illegal immigrant .
what we need be to leave european union and regain control we border .
there be many member state in eu whose citizen should not be allow into britain without visa .
what we do not need be system devise by european union .
however , it might have some unintended consequence .
look at another example eu legislation champion by liberal democrat .
any corrupt legal system may now demand surrender british citizen , and we have to comply .
we have surrender right to protect we own citizen .
soon we will have trial in absentia and common recognition fine and confiscation order .
all this be vote for and welcome by liberal democrat .
now liberal democrat fanatic want we to embrace common system for application visa .
firstly , i disagree with use external service provider .
secondly , there should have be better datum protection .
diplomatic protection be vital to ensure effective protection personal rights individual .
be we already forget swift case , involve transmission datum gar by we authority ?
thirdly , cost visa will rise and will vary from country to country .
commission proposal aim to prevent visa shopping .
we will therefore be encourage exactly what we want to combat , namely visa shopping .
this will particularly apply in case family with several member .
as result all this , madam president , i can not accept this compromise .
introduction fingerprint and photograph will ensure that new visa can not be forge or misuse .
we will guarantee that they will be follow , because necessary precaution have be take .
in my country we have have very positive experience in this respect .
for this reason , i be support this more citizen friendly approach .
up to this point i also support rapporteur and i would like to congratulate she .
in course we work together , this have not always be case , baroness ludford .
i regret this .
i think that observe protection personal datum in particular be important for this regulation .
in practical term , this datum must be store and process in accordance with specific european legislation .
at same time , it also guarantee sufficient opportunity for protect travellerspersonal datum and human integrity .
it will also result in overall improvement in eu poss image .
i shall convey to my colleague mr barrot all that they have say today .
they have be excellent .
danoka . position m kaufmann and m ?
i be very sad that mr coelho be not able to support this compromise .
after all they be in my original report .
mr batten have leave chamber .
i think that be part ukip election campaign .
i think mr batten , as usual , be somewhat muddle in he think .
i thank all or speaker who make constructive contribution .
vote will take place on wednesday .
furthermore , we need to focus particular attention on protect biometric datum those who have supply it .
this regulation offer possibility cooperation with external service provider for collect visa application .
novel food debate
i must also mention cooperation with czech presidency .
i be also surprise that commission proposal take internal market as its start point .
i will begin with that point .
innovation be , course , tremendously important .
that bring i on to my second point , namely what arenovel food , actually ?
that be never really make clear in commission proposal .
let i deal with nanotechnology first .
i have absolutely no idea what it be .
it therefore need to come within scope regulation .
this be not really safety issue .
i fully agree that it be essential to uphold precautionary principle .
however , i do not consider draft report to be very satisfactory .
we also believe that any regulation should be proportionate and practical .
that may sound reasonable , but who be to establish such fact and base upon what evidence ?
would not some exist product also be ban under such edict ?
we agree with need for commission to present legislative proposal on cloning .
we also agree with need to strengn datum protection for certain period .
it relate to question regard nanoparticle and nanomaterial .
this be extremely important issue and its importance be grow .
we will also support some amendment .
we hope that we can still reach agreement with commission fairly soon .
for example , we can not demand that novel food have no negative impact on environment .
reintroduce application under revise regulation would only mean further delay and cost for industry .
we must be consistent in political message we send to commission and to citizen .
therefore , novel food regulation be not appropriate framework for such complex issue .
we will also support label nano ingredient .
people have right to know what they eat and make they choice accordingly .
if some people be concern about nanotechnology , then they should be able to make different choice .
procedure must protect consumer from danger unhealthy food and from be mislead .
we need definition nanomaterial and clear label .
in case gene technology , we must close label loophole as quickly as possible .
food which come from animal that have be feed gmo feedstuff must be label .
we have traceability on paper , so it will be possible .
we will see tomorrow how member from germany have vote , because there be label loophole here .
we do not want to take away consumersright to choose for themselves .
they should have freedom choice and opportunity to make they own decision .
we should make this very clear in this regulation .
my final point be that animal should not be subject to unnecessary suffer .
for this reason , we be call for ban on duplicate animal testing .
commission have submit good proposal for update regulation on novel food .
we have already hear about all this .
anything which involve gmo legislation should not be include in regulation on novel food .
who be you aim to pillory for this ?
my group have always support right consumer to know what food contain .
why should there not be reference to nanosubstance in list ingredient ?
therefore i recommend that my group vote in favor amendment .
however , it have now become clear how beneficial this postponement be for they .
brief remark on cloning .
it be animal cruelty and we be oppose to it .
to avoid misunderstanding , this report do not address genetically modify food .
europe would suffer serious competitive disadvantage if it be leave out development in this area .
key be scientific , comprehensive testing that accompany licensing process , guarantee by propose regulation .
major consideration be strict regulatory system label .
we must not allow food in question to be open to mislead consumer .
there be also significant debate concern clone animal .
it would be more appropriate to regulate cloning in separate regulation .
we need to make this absolutely clear to consumer .
yet development animal cloning as method food production be be pursue without public awareness .
after all , clone cause great distress to animal .
i also regard amendment 60 as important .
why do we respond as if we be scientific illiterate on any new aspect this area ?
have none we , or very few we , scientific background in this parliament at all ?
same question can be ask national parliament .
we must base legislation on thorough , serious science and accept that .
if not , we credibility as legislator be in question .
there be some critical comment too , course .
that , too , i be happy with , as it can only be good for debate .
through we input and we proposal , we will succeed in achieve this aim .
i would also like to thank commissioner for what she say about animal cloning .
substance that deplete ozone layer recast debate
we atmosphere be form in such way that there be two different layer that protect we .
co2 in tropospheric layer hold in warmth so that we do not get too cold .
thus , those substance that be be prohibit act both to deplete ozone and to increase global warm .
it be already prohibit to produce hcfc , and they use will be ban from 20thi be important policy basis .
sixty four amendment be adopt in committee on environment , public health and food safety .
there be then two trialogue , which result in agreement between council and parliament .
i would like to briefly mention nine important result that agreement .
first all , legal basis for regulation have be change to environment .
that allow member state possibility adopt more far reach measure to protect environment .
secondly , use pesticide methyl bromide will be prohibit as 18 march 20thus also apply to gas container to control vermin .
only remain exception will be for emergency , such as where large scale epidemic occur .
fourthly , hcfc may only be use in government designate business .
fifthly , some new substance have be add to list substance that be nominate for restrictive measure .
european commission have undertake to investigate these substance further .
it have also be agree , in this regard , that there must be no increase in laboratory use .
eighth point be that attention be be give to enforcement by means inspection .
there be , however , more to be do in order to tackle problem store ozone deplete substance .
commission have important job here .
all in all , we have achieve satisfactory result .
apart from protect ozone layer , limit these substance have extremely positive repercussion on climate .
however , in order to make this possible , number persistent problem need to be overcome .
this will put community legislation on methyl bromide at vanguard at global level .
benefit , both in term restore ozone layer and reduce greenhouse gas , will be considerable .
european commission be in position to accept in full compromise package amendment .
montreal protocol be consider to be one most successful all international environmental agreement .
montreal protocol itself have have addition make to it no less than four time .
20 year old treaty be amend in this way in london , copenhagen , montreal and beijing .
it be this same wisdom that we now need in case kyoto protocol .
as be often way with solution to environmental problem , however , another aspect to problem emerge .
some they be more than thousand time more intense as global warmer than carbon dioxide .
it thus become necessary to amend weak point in treaty .
it will not cut global emission and will not even reduce carbon intensiveness .
climate change be environmental problem on totally different scale from earlier problem .
world still run on carbon .
that be why climate change must be see above all as problem industrial engineering .
let we learn lesson from montreal .
due to quantity methane release into atmosphere , it should also be include in further work .
uen support this regulation .
i thank mr blokland for he labor intensive and relevant report .
many these substance be powerful greenhouse gas , but they have noneless be exclude from kyoto treaty .
that be because it be think that they would be regulate under montreal protocol .
i hope that this principle will be incorporate into legislation when next step be take .
that be fine , mr doyle , please do so .
these substance , we must remind ourselves , also have global warm potential .
mr doyle , you be as good as you word .
we still know little about this substance , and its production , for that matter .
in that way we will be obtain precise information about this substance .
we mutual cooperation have be excellent , in committee and in negotiation .
in every case , result be satisfactory .
i have one more comment to make , in conclusion .
i be not very happy with recast system .
it be not easy to know on what basis you can or can not make amendment .
recast remain difficult issue for work this parliament .
key challenge be as follow
we health be maintain through clean environment and atmosphere around we .
consequently , i totally agree with additional measure be take to limit or even ban ozone deplete substance .
lady and gentleman , we have note internal political situation in czech republic .
spring council provide proof that .
there be relatively strong turn out .
topic attract greatest attention be course question how to resolve current economic crisis .
i completely reject assertion that we be do little in way more profound measure .
we agree that all short term measure must be temporary and that be how we view they .
we should take look at history book , which have clearly be gar dust .
g20 summit will provide just one opportunity for we to talk about this .
if any these be undercut , then we would emerge from this crisis in weaker state .
there be no reason for pessimism ahead g20 discussion , as mr rasmussen fear .
current crisis , as we all know , be crisis confidence .
third key area for resolve crisis be therefore restoration confidence .
it be not enough simply to pour money into system .
bank must start lend money but they will not if they do not have confidence .
liquidity that be available to they have not solve problem .
confidence can neither be decree nor purchase .
we have agree even on this .
market be nervous , react immediately , excessively and negatively to every signal .
we therefore need better regulation .
i would emphasise thatbettermight mean introduction regulation where none have exist so far .
this be where you step in , lady and gentleman european parliament .
it be precisely here that most noise and criticism be center in my view undeservedly .
plan be allegedly deficient , slow and unambitious .
i would like to set record straight .
second major me european council be climate and energy question .
we make significant progress both in energy security and climate protection .
gas crisis have not be resolve .
it be more than clear that we need this .
climate debate discussion and preparation be already begin for copenhagen conference .
we be try to find joint position at european level .
decision we take be right one .
i would like to pre empt question about participation belarus .
we be consider this .
at this moment we be hold door open to belarus but no decision have be take .
organisational detail have still not be finalize but you will all be inform in detail .
there be many or issue at european council about which i be ready to respond .
it prove that , even when time be tough , solidarity be not hollow word in europe .
debate that we hold yesterday with uk prime minister , gordon brown , clearly demonstrate this .
this be not technocratic agenda .
people must be there install at heart global economy .
we be in favor open and competitive economy , but economy in which market serve citizen .
it point out that we be in favor social market economy .
however , european council also look beyond crisis .
this investment be critical in these difficult time .
we all know that credit crunch have have direct impact on strategic project .
there be some challenge , particularly possibility freeze on oil and gas connection .
it have put brake on investment in renewable energy .
it have also put research on clean technology on hold .
therefore , we need to have clear european response .
same be true package exist and forthcoming measure on financial system .
i be very happy with that result .
we also need to continue to deepen work coordination .
coordination be key coordination and implementation .
we have some instrument .
we also have instrument lisbon strategy that remain in force .
same spirit should inspire we as we prepare for employment summit .
unemployment be rise and most likely will go on rise .
this be my number one concern , and i think it should be number one concern in europe .
worker all over europe must know that european leader care .
as you will know , european council decide that summit should take place in troika format .
to be open and frank with you as i always be i be disappoint with this decision .
i think we see willingness social partner to engage with we .
we have invite social partner to come to commission .
i be determine that we should have all possible option on table .
you have wealth knowledge about action on ground .
we need to keep up momentum process .
this be meaning european integration .
we need more job , and this package measure will allow this .
climate change will not wait for end crisis .
27 request this last week we expect to have road map in june .
it do you honor in you difficult circumstance .
in any case , you be topple by two civil democratic party vote and two green vote .
so what about obstruction by you own people ?
you say that path that we be take be historically wrong path .
that be what you say here few moment ago .
you say that geithner poss way be wrong way and lead to hell .
that be not level at which european union can work with we .
that be big mistake that you be make here .
no , mr president in office , that be way to take european union back up blind alley .
president commission say something very important today .
he say that it would be serious mistake to deny social summit , employment summit .
we have no time for that .
that be fatal signal .
that be wrong signal .
we do not want troika we want discussion open to everyone .
secondly , please there convene social summit .
show european public that employment policy and initiative to protect job be at center government action .
i personally feel very sorry for you .
we be here to help you .
no problem , we be by you side and will do whatever we can .
we must still be able to demand minimum institutional respect .
nek , and then you will regain some prestige with we .
all these be welcome .
investment in transport , infrastructure and broadband connection will create job now and prepare europe for future .
meanwhile , money go to nabucco pipeline will ease we trouble energy reliance on russia .
but for all apparent agreement , niggling nuance remain over member statespriority .
this be false choice .
long term and short term both must be address .
we leader must be clear about that at g20 summit .
if we can not agree on we common cause then we can not hope to punch at we collective weight .
america will come to g20 with she own agenda .
we must arrive with ours and together reach deal that deliver for all .
that moment have pass for you government .
for europe it be yet to come .
see to it that domestic difficulty do not sap you stride .
nek and he entire cabinet have prove that it be possible .
however , because we be among friend , we must speak sincerely .
i will start with support for eastern partnership .
together this mean barely eur 20 million annually for each country which be part project .
be that really sufficient for eu to build its influence in region ?
it seem to i that absolutely nothing have be decide .
in fact decision have be make to refuse any kind cooperation in this area .
we can see obstruction for same reason when we consider construction nabucco gas pipeline .
at summit eur 5 billion be also allocate to anti crisis package .
therefore i propose extend time frame availability for these fund .
participant that summit unanimously oppose economic protectionism .
nek to put end to this .
this morning i would like wake up call .
we be in system crisis , and this system crisis can quickly develop into societal crisis .
roosevelt in 1930 win political battle against fascist europe lose it .
so , why do roosevelt win ?
what be four element trust which roosevelt win ?
first be reregulation .
roosevelt heavily attack oligopoly , big company in we , and reregulate economy .
even if gordon brown be champion deregulation , maybe this show that change can happen .
secondly , strengn social fabric .
roosevelt poss fourth issue be he economic investment .
we do not want to go to war .
war we have to win today be war against planet .
we war be green investment that be where we have to win war .
one be that we need green eurobond .
second , we have to bring city europe into game .
that be win economy and it be win heart citizen for europe .
however , problem be one who can restore confidence and how it can be restore .
i would like to comment again on eastern partnership .
we be therefore establish sphere influence and thus do something ourselves which we sharply criticise in or .
conclusion summit in this regard be very vague .
throughout crisis i have repeatedly question commission about its desire to regulate and control financial sector .
it have no desire to do so .
it continually refer to right internal market to govern what happen .
he say that economy europe be too different for euro .
bingo , mr delor !
that be precisely what they be .
single currency be part problem , not part solution .
i also welcome postponement decision over financing climate move .
nek lose vote confidence . minister and eu council president mirek topol ?
clav klaus have strongest political mandate in czech republic .
all concern about irresponsibility czech republic be therefore completely unnecessary .
that too be democracy .
that be point number one .
system quite simply work .
in my opinion this be definitely not minor task and it will cost lot money .
there be great difference between proclaim fine word on street corner and put they into practice .
i will not be respond to comment party leader mr schulz .
berlusconus do that before last election and i have no wish to repeat he mistake .
neverless , it be impossible that banknote printer will be only one to profit from this crisis .
that would not be good thing .
job summit .
we propose full format to european council , course .
it be not we decision that this summit would be troika .
lisbon treaty .
i will allow myself one joke today .
i have to say that responsibility for move situation forwards really lie with those who create situation .
commission .
we will course consult with you it be essential to have discussion with european parliament .
i think that 17 day would give we enough time for debate .
further discussion relate to question about regulation versus stimulus measure .
in my opinion this be only option for tackle situation .
i have already mention stimulus package .
second pillar this structure be regulation , which lie partially in you hand .
it be also partially mention in larosi?there report , which be fine piece work .
we be not under time pressure from day to day to come up with new regulation .
we be under time pressure to limit any possible future problem .
it mark significant step towards stabilise situation .
i be recently in azerbaijan where i speak with president aliyev .
eu must remain sort lighthouse for these country .
if light be extinguish in this lighthouse , development in these country will not be under we control .
in conclusion i would like to say something about social impact .
here i must return to tripartite and applaud role both social partner .
we do not talk about how much money we would give to people .
workforce mobility .
this be barrier to solution .
i would like to say in conclusion something about eu we summit .
. ? finally like to say something about remark mr bobo ??
czech administration be manage situation very well so far .
thank you mr president in office european council .
he be so right to remind we all fundamental principle that underline eu .
he ignore he role in put in place and operate fundamentally flaw financial regulatory framework .
europe need no lecture from british government about what must be do to get out this crisis .
council here today be council silence and council illusion .
i be sorry , but i have not see any concrete measure .
yes , eur 5 billion , but what be that ?
that be 0.04 % this union poss gross national product .
you have not understand that this crisis be very deep , serious recession .
business be demand , worker be demand , we be demand do more !
imf have propose that you invest 2 % gdp this year and next year .
mr barroso , you say that we be do well we be invest 3.3 % .
that be what you say two week ago , but now it have increase to 4 % .
i ask myself how be that ?
well , calculation be simple .
unemployment be increase when expenditure on unemployment benefit increase , financial stimulus will increase .
please , we can not do it in this way .
what we need be real investment . way .
what you must tell people be that you be commit to new recovery plan .
we be on you side and will support you in get that .
now it be propose this summit on 7 may should be reduce to troika .
this unemployment crisis will not disappear because we refuse to have more meeting .
it will still be there .
this be about destiny european union poss economic , monetary and social effort .
if you can do that , we will be with you .
supervisory legislation must be amend and precaution for crisis management improve .
legislation govern financial sector should have effect blunt rather than exacerbate economic cycle .
however , more regulation do not necessarily mean better regulation what we need be right regulation .
we also have proof how important common market be to prosperity and stability in europe .
internal market be play central role in shorten and dampen recession in europe .
however , it be also clear that test have not yet be pass .
european union must hold fast to its principle .
czech presidency stand for this and i hope that we can continue to count on that .
he say now that banking regulation must be tighten up , tax haven tackle and imf reform .
he own record manage uk economy be one negligence and catastrophe .
he be architect current economic crisis , not savior world .
he favor light touch regulation that be direct cause problem in banking .
impact downturn be , course , be feel around world .
he say that path take by we have be historically discredit .
that surprise i .
this be where correction should apply .
that stand in pertinent contradiction to any form fight against cause crisis .
agreement at eu summit last week be not strong enough to instigate new , sustainably orient economy .
european union must take lead in that regard .
climate deal . agreement on funding balus and pozna ?
where be eu poss leadership when it come to tangible funding ?
that be not leadership that be need in run up to copenhagen .
cut need to be make during crisis .
there be sufficient margin for savings , for example in uncontrolled growth eu agency .
de mr president , lady and gentleman , i should like to congratulate czech presidency .
when i listen to chairman socialist group , i think i be on another planet .
how can someone who have obstruct that for decade today be declare we savior ?
i do not understand that .
live on credit be problem .
i would like to say how typical and characteristic that be for this government .
these characteristic and this inability to cooperate be real cause for collapse he government .
however , i do not want to focus on czech domestic politics .
ahead we lie many task .
economic and financial crisis have course already be mention .
in conclusion i would like to comment once again on lisbon treaty .
czech social democrat have always support european constitution and have always support ratification lisbon treaty .
what must we do to avoid these problem ?
firstly , country must evaluate effect integration on they own national economic policy .
now decision be often take on basis past history , how we behave in situation crisis .
secondly , some sort temporary institutional framework must be create for decision implementation mechanism .
wait until lisbon agreement be ratify ?
people poss life do not wait , we have to take decision today .
it be obvious that there must be greater coordination between country in eurozone and non eurozone country .
how can this be achieve ?
this would help bring both europe , new europe and old europe , closer together and find consensus .
pl mr president , during recent european summit many subject be raise .
one these be question eastern partnership and alternative route gas supply .
europe be face huge economic crisis and must look for effective way out it .
however , we must not depart from we guide principle solidarity .
we should be especially sensitive to problem new member state .
domestic situation in czech republic should not in any way interfere with this .
we need to dare to try something new if we be to make headway in this crisis .
my honorable friend be right we be live on credit .
however , we be also live on credit as far as environment and climate be concern .
we have endlessly squander resource .
we be not manage economy in sustainable manner .
unfortunately , european council be not currently muster up that much courage .
unfortunately , i do not believe that czech republic alone be to blame .
thank you , mr harm .
we be all sinner some more than other .
this will require proactive intervention by member state government .
free market theology must not stand in way do right by worker .
light touch regulation financial market be always road to rip off and corruption .
obsessive deregulation and privatisation public service will equally end in tear .
so , be common refrain that we must learn lesson this economic crisis genuine ?
lisbon treaty be old hat .
it be charter for policy failure .
we need new treaty for new time .
fr mr president , presidency conclusion from last council make for amusing reading .
they resemble victory statement route army everywhere .
that dogma be completely wrong .
we should return to we society poss traditional economic vision social justice and genuine production .
my congratulation on result summit .
however , we be not deal with any that today .
you presidency , just like you government , represent politics double standard .
you have fail to integrate you own government .
clav klaus as president also belong to politics double standard .
this aim can not be achieve without ratify lisbon treaty .
treaty be now under serious threat and this be partly also you responsibility .
if you continue to govern in any form , you should make clear stand for ratification .
my own party , european democratic party , will do all it can for ratification .
second serious omission be euro .
you can participate in g20 summit and represent europe at summit .
it be important to have european security commission and to maintain stability pact .
nek , propose measure be excellent .
at present they be only proposal .
as mr merkel have say , what matter be implementation .
what be need be political will and unity which will make it possible to translate this into reality .
you be talk about crisis confidence .
that be what we have here .
it be increase unemployment and wider gap that it entail .
they must have be extremely disappoint with result most recent summit .
absolutely no strategy for deal with rise unemployment be establish at that summit .
they say that they have already do what need to be do .
european parliament be not involve at all one month before european parliament election .
i would like to say something briefly about automatic stabiliser .
gm , unite state and sweden have be mention in debate today .
thus , it be not quite so wonderful any more .
finally , i would like to say few word about mobility .
mobility be important within eu and so be fight against protectionism .
then we can also work to promote increase mobility and to combat protectionism .
we could discuss that for many hour .
alongside that though , issue what we spend that money on be perhaps even more important .
we have definitely get thing wrong way round there .
another point be solution for eastern european country and country that be not in single currency .
we economy be strong but have be weaken , just like economy all over world at present .
as old say in ireland go there be no strength without unity .
i , too , have expect truer european dimension in approach to crisis .
that be what european union be for .
solidarity with less develop country must also form part european union poss global approach .
i will conclude with quick word about treaty lisbon .
we , parliament , must set out we position clearly .
we must know for certain what be go to happen straight after european election .
this sort investment be furthermore especially suit to we time .
now we need real action .
unfortunately , summit be unable to convince people this .
this must also be outcome meeting g20 country .
when europe speak with one voice , unite state america will also then adopt this same objective .
sv mr president , berlin wall fall almost 20 year ago .
this must not be allow to happen !
it be worry that renault be move it production from slovenia to france .
we must not allow spectre protectionism to wreak havoc once again .
cost fail , once more , to keep europe together be far too high .
history will punish those who fail in they responsibility .
same must also apply to president sarkozy .
there be every reason to welcome proposal by de larosi?there group .
european central bank will have even more important role .
national supervisory authority will also be give better opportunity to coordinate themselves and exchange information .
policy must be appropriate even in time crisis .
propose regulation that hinder rather than help must not be we response in difficult time .
mr president , council poss declaration on eastern partnership be most welcome .
this measure will help stabilise country like hungary and latvium .
however , we must not forget ukraine either , which be suffer severe financial turmoil .
member euronest be sovereign state with right to decide they own euro atlantic aspiration .
such language belong to machtpolitik cold war era , not to modern diplomacy .
mr president , my congratulation on you pronunciation my rather difficult name !
conservative here and in member state be like naughty child .
that , my friend , be recipe for fan uncontrollable forest fire .
nek choose sweden as comparison to america .
why not czech republic ?
why not ireland ?
let we have employment summit for all member state on 7 may .
why do i begin with these perhaps unpleasant remark ?
we must welcome as extremely positive result agreement on energy project and broadband internet .
not only have financial credit contract but also social credit .
therefore , social european union summit , lead towards european pact on employment , be must .
this global crisis be aggravate by crisis european integration .
there be member state host mor company economy and member state with economy subsidiary .
former be member euro area , latter be not .
program to facilitate stabilisation and integration latter be crucial for survival former .
european union can not survive with new demarcation line .
i wish we all success in this matter .
pt summit poss response be not ambitious enough .
where be firm commitment to abolish tax haven and offshore financial center ?
where be decision to moralise salary banking executive ?
this be not way to restore people poss trust .
lastly , i hear someone say that they do not need socialist proposal .
that be arrogant statement .
will they never learn ?
i fear that crisis will continue for many year , which be not what we want .
implementation procedure can be too clumsy and time consuming .
it be especially important to accommodate framework condition for small business and for innovation .
now it be really time to invest more in research , education and training .
as usual crisis provide opportunity for reform .
and , most importantly , crisis be no excuse for protectionism .
eur 5 billion for strategic energy project and broadband internet .
eur 75 billion for international monetary fund .
eur 600 million for eastern partnership .
be this lot or too little ?
be glass half full or half empty ?
under normal circumstance , i would judge result and agreement achieve by european council as satisfactory .
undoubtedly we need to develop energy infrastructure , but not at expense reduce consumption .
european union continue to be commit to play lead role in copenhagen global climate agreement .
mr president , i wish to begin by thank czech presidency for successful summit .
i see three main priority that we should focus on .
first , course , be job .
second , i be happy that we manage to eliminate partly , at least protectionist tendency .
neverless , they be still alive , and i think solidarity be key .
third point key be to restore confidence in market .
to be honest , i do not think it be helpful to pit these solution against each or .
thus we need unite action and pro active approach , not invisible hand .
with regard to fiscal stimulus , during course morning we have have considerable debate .
be it too little ?
be unite state do more than we ?
with regard to stability pact , i note certain contradiction in commission poss position .
my dear sir , we be against monetary inflation and we be also against speak time inflation .
be it match for what be at stake ?
nek , this be call for action .
if self satisfaction and fiction be instrument economic recovery , then we might call it success .
determine to do what ?
agenda for this council have already be expurgate any proposal that might have relate to employment .
that be postpone until may .
what would be worry be if this approach be to rub off on all member state .
mr schulz should not try and tell we that he alone advocate social europe .
precisely opposite be true .
ro economic crisis be take serious toll on europe poss enterprise and citizen .
european union need economic development and europe poss citizen need job and decent wages .
unfortunately , energy efficiency , which can create job , do not feature in january poss regulation .
yesterday poss deal on roam be sensational and citizen europe stand to gain from it .
c in table more proposal for progressive depreciation . ?
that would trigger job and growth .
crisis should be use as catalyst for economic restructuring , and not just in car industry .
decision we take there be fundamental and important .
i would like to say one thing to those you who have specific doubt and question .
actual decision on eur 5 billion for energy project and broadband internet be important .
many you ask how we will tackle problem unemployment .
many you comment be concern with issue eu openness .
i would like to reassure those you who have any doubt concern certain matter .
yes , we do have domestic problem and we know full well who initiate confidence motion .
mr vondra , many colleague have thank czech presidency for its contribution .
nek . so at begin , in presence prime minister topol ?
i would like to thank you for you very committed personal contribution .
good luck for continuation you work .
let i conclude .
whenever i conclude , i see crowd come in to listen !
laughter
we can be proud what we have decide , but there should be no room for complacency .
american be come closer to we position regard fight against climate change , and we welcome that .
american be come closer to need to reinforce welfare system .
i wish to express my support for decision adopt at recent european union summit hold in brussels .
they have be lock up illegally by bush administration , which clearly violate international law .
it be , therefore , first and foremost american problem that need to be solve by washington .
this be base purely on assumption .
e mr president , guant√†`namo be problem that be not create by european union .
yet it be clear that we do not create it ourselves .
this be clear duty that we should carry out .
there be no doubt that each case must be deal with individually .
prisoner guant√†`namo can not be deal with as if they be undifferentiated herd .
they be people with rights , but also with they own personal story .
what be figure for spain , italy or any or member state ?
will europe be able to reform control its own secret service ?
will union be able to rehabilitate victim via legal process and compensation ?
i welcome mr barrot poss declaration intent to this end .
first point resolution mention important change in unite statespolicy concern humanitarian law .
i say this for attention czech presidency , which seem to have different idea .
i would not wish obama enthusiast to suffer any early disappointment .
el mr president , inhumane prison at guant√†`namo should never have be open .
not one european government , not one national parliament , have invite we .
let they do so even now , so that this sort illegal practice be never repeat .
we need to know wher european union will have power and competency to play role .
european union must collaborate .
if we do not do this , we risk be irrelevant in process close guant√†`namo .
it be not acceptable to say now that this problem be not we business .
i stress that it be not only we moral duty but also we political responsibility .
ro combate terrorism be number one priority modern society .
however , mistake have be commit and controversial decision have be make in name this desire objective .
as regard commissioner barrot poss reference to romania , accusation have be make in past without any basis .
romanian parliament have carry out investigation and supply result to interested party .
i believe that this be totally adequate .
i also believe that romania have give adequate reply to completely baseless accusation which have be level .
de mr president , there be no question that responsibility for guant√†`namo lie with usa .
i be think , for example , about uighur who can not return to china .
we can not decide wher or not they want to live in usa .
however , one thing must be make clear .
right to presumption innocence must apply in this case .
as head police authority , this minister should pack he bag and go .
we should think carefully about that .
each member state will decide on basis its own law wher to receive they or not .
we look away we turn we back .
for this reason , we must make it clear that question credibility be great political importance .
during course this debate , i have sometimes have quite different impression .
someone today speak about refugee .
these be not refugee .
european responsibility for violation rule law and human rights can not be erase .
position european parliament on terrorism be equally clear .
it be fact that unite state have shoulder most burden in fight against terrorism .
however , they have also make huge mistake .
it be huge mistake to create guant√†`namo .
it be huge mistake to treat detainee as they do .
it be huge mistake to transport they as they do .
this have be say in this parliament .
how be european union involve ?
they wish to destroy we world , which be find on respect for human rights and devotion to freedom .
attack on september 11 demonstrate that terrorist be prepare to use any means whatsoever .
unite state undertake to defend free world on behalf we all .
europe need to feel responsible for war on global terrorism .
often , se method amount to torture .
no means deem inadmissible under sign international convention may be use .
chechen nation be murder before we very eye .
that should put end to debate on secret prison and transit flight .
this mean not just europe , but also unite state , as well as or .
after all , people in guant√†`namo bay be prisoner , and not people that can be trifle with .
this be particularly worry and this concern must be set out in joint resolution .
i refer to polish citizen age 42 who be kidnap .
he be seize in border area between afghanistan and pakistan .
he be geologist who be work there .
he have be hold in area ever since .
now , we should not have to be ask about accept guant√†`namo detainee .
we can decide ourselves to sign bilateral agreement with we , as portugal have do .
cohesive leadership be now need from irish government in this regard .
mr president , eu have be ask for closure guant√†`namo for long time .
moreover , internal investigation have not support accusation either .
at most , it be simply cynical manipulation for obscure purpose .
some they have not even be charge and duly try .
obama make popular gesture and be now decide what to do with they .
socialist government portugal do not collaborate with bush administration quite contrary .
mr president , prison at guant√†`namo bay be necessary creation unite state at time .
its closure be now matter for unite state .
torture be unacceptable and there be no exceptional circumstance to alter this truth .
martin report be best example this approach .
it contain accusation against romania which be both controversial and unfounded .
se be classic asylum case .
europe must learn to speak with one voice and to take unite action .
we join fight against terrorism to defend human rights .
now we need to be involve in help unite state to defend human rights .
pl lady and gentleman , there be two side to this matter .
i believe that citizen country should be readmit into they country origin .
union be now unit , and this problem must therefore be consider .
unless they be free from such stigma , nobody will wish to accept they .
this be serious problem that merit consideration .
i will conclude by say that problem mainly concern unite state america .
i believe it be very useful .
it be certainly more complex than that .
graham watson speak need to approach this with one voice .
it be not about wash ourselves but not get wet .
there be also tactical debate .
but if we do receive request , we need to be prepare to react .
therefore , council start to discuss this seriously on second day after president obama poss decision .
this be one level .
so there be internal imperative for coordinate approach .
some you have raise question speed can we act faster than we be do now ?
i think we should be aware that discussion have only just begin .
it have only be one week .
furthermore , it have to be keep in mind that primary responsibility for guant√†`namo rest with we .
clear position respective member state on resettlement detainee be not yet know .
mr president , commission broadly share view express by mr vondra .
it be key turn point in fight against terrorism .
it be true , however , that initial responsibility lie with unite state .
this really be essential condition .
unite state must send we clear and reason request for each individual case .
that be absolutely essential .
we could then possibly add financial assistance to facilitate reception in some member state .
i would say in mr vondra poss presence that we will naturally work closely with czech presidency .
terrorism must be combate vigorously , but human rights must still be respect .
speculation mention romania in connection with cium poss secret prison be totally unfounded .
no one have be able to prove they existence in romania .
both romanian authority and public opinion strongly uphold respect for human rights .
may eu be ashamed its failure to act .
worry situation in retention center for immigrant , especially in island mayotte and lampedusa debate
i should like to begin by underline two fundamental principle which lie at heart today poss debate .
we have respond by develop , over last 10 year , effective eu asylum and migration policy .
all party stand to gain by such approach .
development and shape eu asylum and migration policy depend on you input too .
you have specifically raise situation on island mayotte and lampedusa .
we should take care to distinguish between two type migratory flow in se two case .
council will shortly begin consideration this new proposal and look forward to work closely with you .
until now , legislation and practice regard detention in member state have vary considerably .
it also , through most recent legislation , set commonly agree standard on return policy .
we asylum and migration policy be thus root in rule law .
it ensure respect for human rights and for dignity individual .
i be well aware , however , that some you find this directive insufficient .
we be , course , talk here about asylum seeker .
we therefore now have legal framework and it must , course , be put to use .
i now turn to question that parliament want to raise in this debate .
this be case with presidium project and european refugee fund emergency measure .
in addition , few week ago , commission approve emergency aid eur 7 million .
i be rely on effort mr ferrero waldner to achieve quick result in current negotiation .
i now turn to mayotte .
those be remark i wish to make to you .
that be why i will be make se visit to see how thing be work on ground .
i would like , in any case , to thank parliament for have open this debate .
people reside illegally on island mayotte account for 30 % population .
yes , you hear correctly , i say 30 % population .
this be percentage which be unknown in we european country , thank god .
french authority be well aware se difficulty .
work to renovate current detention center have just be complete to improve live condition detainee significantly .
this should be open in june 20mr president , lady and gentleman , to thwart illegal immigration , one have to be unkind .
it seem parody policy and yet it be policy italian government .
today , we have speak about closure guant√†`namo .
most those who be in lampedusa be asylum seeker .
we often have 180 day detention , include for those who be flee from political persecution or war .
1 200 people die in 2008 when try to cross mediterranean .
those who manage to survive , many go through torment lampedusa .
report about tragedy unfold at we external border be as plain as day .
urgency be great , and have be for while .
this be also what council have note time and again but only on paper .
it could almost be consider ironic that we be also vote on roure report this week .
this report contain we find further to we visit to all hot spot , include lampedusa .
european union be fall short , and not just by little .
lack solidarity be shocking .
nobody , not one single person in this parliament , be suggest that this be simple task .
experience have teach we that council tend to cry off at crucial moment .
and this be quite apart from enforcement .
after electoral campaign , i shall bring they to he attention .
however , all you statement remain formal and reflect wishful think that will not be follow by action .
i fear that this especially apply to you statement , mr vondra .
how will it be spend ?
therefore , what sort trust can we have in action this kind ?
they be hold in such inhumane and degrade condition that center explode into true democratic emergency .
hence , there be genuine emergency and cause it be italian government policy .
citizen lampedusa have become aware this , mr muscardinus .
they have also ask italian government to modify its position on center for temporary stay .
it be good commissioner barrot to go to lampedusa in next few day and i appreciate this .
i have prepare dossier and send it to mr barrot .
in next few day , my group , too , will organise delegation that will visit lampedusa .
after lampedusa , visit be also make to place include canary island , nerland and poland .
this morning , we discuss proposal to tackle illegal employment in absence council .
period within which member state have to transpose se directive into legislation be two year .
issue immigration be urgent , though , and two year period be too long .
it be shocking that reception situation at lampedusa should need to be discuss in this manner again .
i would therefore call on council presidency to make this priority .
detention center be not build to cope with this capacity .
we have know this for three year .
old nato base be be rebuild to house more immigrant , but this be not adequate solution .
i would call on italy to be open and transparent about treatment immigrant on lampedusa .
nl everyone have be aware problem surround lampedusa for year .
capsize ship with unfortunate asylum seeker before european coast be , in recent year , regular occurrence .
europe should dare to send clear message , for desperate time call for desperate measure .
we should come down hard on human trafficker , and they punishment can not be severe enough .
only then will debate such as one we be hold today prove unnecessary in future .
it mr president , lady and gentleman , nothing in this house surprise i any more .
i be sorry that he be not here in house .
neverless , mr president , some ignorant and stupid thing have be say by some people on this occasion .
what be consequence this ?
i believe that it be important to give you few figure .
in 2007 , around 11 000 migrant arrive in lampedusa .
in 2008 , three time as many arrive , about 31 000 .
76 request be examine in 3 day .
after assertion that have be make , be patient .
now what count be true fact lampedusa and malta and or be carry terrible burden .
citizen be not annoy with italian government .
they be annoyed because they themselves can no longer endure this situation .
decision to end transfer to italy be create real problem access to asylum procedure .
detention condition be degrade and affront to human dignity .
what therefore should be do ignore rule ?
enough then demagoguery !
sv unfortunately , no country can have unrestricted immigration in this world .
when that happen , we must preserve rule law .
we must treat se people as free citizen and with respect .
we must protect they human rights pend examination question wher they be asylum seeker or not .
what we be talk about now seem very strange to i .
why should those who arrive on island lampedusa be force to remain there forever ?
they will , naturally , be relocate around country pend legal examination they case .
same must be do in italy .
no individual state , operate on its own , can achieve require result .
this be important work at both domestic and international level .
that be to say , those who qualify be accept .
when we visit , camp have be clear and detainee replace by puppet .
course , we in european union must show solidarity .
se represent quite significant number .
what be happen here and we have visit many camp be appalling and completely inhumane .
mr berlusconus say that they can all go and have beer whenever they want to .
this show level intelligence which this man have , in or word , none at all .
i want to make this very clear .
this two face approach be no longer acceptable .
we should not help they .
what have be say be false .
maroni expose this .
in europe , we be all familiar with concept compulsory school attendance .
we should start by allow people who be strand here to have proper education .
this should be we main objective .
perhaps we can include preparatory measure in budget to allow we to offer se people educational opportunity .
mr president , last sunday , boat carry 260 immigrant land on we shore .
2 000 arrive in lampedusa over christmas be nothing compare to this !
we be discuss european issue here and we should include one additional point in discussion .
none people who come to lampedusa or malta have organise boat for themselves .
they come because they have be entice by organise crime organization and have pay great deal money .
let i start with negative limitation .
it also do not fall within council poss remit to implement national provision member state .
now be time to gradually implement that step by step .
there be strategic issue .
europe need to show greater solidarity .
europe have to decide what solidarity be require .
that be absolutely essential
that be not possible .
that be not aim this fund .
i would therefore say to you that we be now go to pay great deal attention .
in general term , i must say that we need policy partnership with country origin .
next item be question time b6 0006 09 .
follow question be address to commission .
european arm market be fragmented and have consequently suffer adverse economic effect since 1990 .
be it willing to allow compensation system ?
this mean that proposal have successfully complete first reading and will shortly be adopt by council .
it will introduce fair and transparent procurement rule applicable throughout union .
this will enhance openness defense market between member state to benefit all .
offset aim at foster industry member state which purchase defense equipment abroad .
economic interest , by contrast , be not sufficient .
vast majority member state and parliament agree with this assessment .
defense directive do , however , offer alternative to offset .
pt i be grateful to commissioner for very full answer that i have just receive .
subject eu israel trade relation
commission have strongly condemn violence in gaza .
this crisis prove once more that israeli palestinian conflict do not have military solution .
only negotiation with full commitment party can bring about last solution .
commission welcome recent cessation hostility in gaza .
eu have call on its partner for help in drive peace process forward .
immediate priority for commission be to alleviate humanitarian suffer population in gaza .
trading relation between eu and israel will continue .
but , commissioner , all we trade agreement have human rights clause in they .
there will be no change in we trade policy , and further development depend on circumstance .
lot people have ask for further supplementary question on this question .
i will , therefore , take supplementary question from mr allister and mr rack .
i would be please if european union could provide balanced response in this respect .
i can assure you that commission always try to be balance .
we try to be balance and to consider all aspect this very complex conflict .
subject internet safety program
who be eligible to apply to take part in program ?
how , and on what activity , will fund from safer internetprogram be spend ?
commission be convince that next one will also be success .
it facilitate national action and initiative in coordinate fashion .
2009 work program be currently subject to commission inter service consultation .
commission will then seek program management committee poss favourable opinion .
pl madam president , commissioner , i warmly welcome this important initiative .
i would simply like to pose one question .
do commissioner have any information on this and what exactly be contemplate ?
in essence , this mean that everything have become much more interactive .
de it be question spend eur 55 million properly .
can you imagine allocate program funding in same way as with eurostar program ?
as such , both positive and dangerous side be very new to society and governmental structure .
safer internet program be one response to threat already identify .
another threat already identify be cyber attack and different attempt to attack and block via internet .
i can assure you that commission and its relevant service be monitor situation intensely .
therefore , i think it would also be good for those enterprise .
however , i can not give concrete answer today on issue young people poss participation .
subject special adviser richard boomer and heysel site
he contract have now be extend .
what lead commissioner to extend this contract ?
which decision by commissioner have mr boomer influence ?
which internal meeting in commission have mr boomer attend since extension ?
will commission give its opinion on this site ?
what be timetable for decision make ?
when will result architectscompetition for rue de la lous be announce ?
all information about he be available on website .
this call be make with full transparency , via publication in official journal .
commission receive nine offer and be currently undertake technical examination they .
accord to information available to european commission , final result be expect in spring 200us be sorry about long answer but detail be also substantial .
i have produce diagram which show career you special advisor .
i would like to ask you how you ensure that no conflict interest come about .
one people who play role in you new offer appear on this diagram .
this be someone who have have business relationship with you special advisor for long time .
so how do you ensure that no conflict interest occur ?
as i say , he must know lot people .
i be absolutely sure that there be no conflict interest .
he have not express any kind suggestion concern we future policy decision .
i be absolutely sure you will hear when this decision be take .
nine site have be suggest , but i do not know where se site be .
i have read in newspaper about some suggestion make .
so far , nothing be clear , so i be very interested to see all se proposal .
de i would like to query something again .
we understand that search be go on for property outside european area .
however , specific change use have be introduce at one site , heysel site .
it will be very clear and transparent decision .
so , to have or site as well be necessity , especially to moderate cost .
that be main idea .
we already have some building and some site outside european quarter .
we have building in beaulieu , we have building on rue de gen√†?ve and some or also .
we be interested in look .
you mention heysel .
i read about it in newspaper .
i do not know anything about heysel .
nothing have be decide .
it be process .
it will be transparent process .
i suggest , though , that we keep out belgian internal debate and interest .
subject euro note and coin counterfeiting
so it be closely monitor .
role be divide .
european central bank be responsible for coordination fight against counterfeiting euro banknote .
commission , especially its olaf service , deal with counterfeiting coin .
it be important to mention that europol be play substantial role in fight counterfeiting .
so this be situation with regard to counterfeiting euro banknote and coin .
in unite state , to counterfeit currency be serious crime .
do we take same attitude in european union ?
first , turkish lira be very well know to i .
so this have be promise at least .
subject efficient spending eu budget
system be as follow .
there be special spending program , which have its own legal basis .
next come implementation , where there be different layer .
this be one internal part .
what be also important in this particular part be that there be share management .
there be also improvement in this area .
completely new instrument have be introduce so call annual summary all report pay agency .
se be carefully analyze for first time last year and this be now be do again .
so situation be improve .
this quantification change also show that there have be improvement .
so european money be quite rigidly manage even too rigidly in some area .
we can show what have be do .
but we can also clearly say that this be far from perfect .
this be huge machine which must work smoothly .
number correction decision relate to structural fund have increase tremendously during this period .
but 11 % represent eur 462 million .
do commissioner think that this be acceptable ?
this be mess , commissioner !
can we expect that this be go to be improve ?
se sample amount to eur 63 million .
all se sample have be correct , recover and necessary document provide .
therefore , 12 % issue from 2006 be resolve .
error be not waste money error be error which be correct .
meanwhile , court auditor have submit this discharge , this report .
se be possible fraud case .
would you support this idea ?
this would provide model efficiency for use european public money .
i would like to ask commission what its point view be on this .
it be question open staff regulation , which be very complicate issue .
concern fund , i do not understand question .
be you suggest that all fund should be merge ?
could you repeat question ?
i think it would be very useful for sustainable economic development european union .
that be huge question .
i can only pass this question to my colleague .
so far , it have be very heated debate in council .
there be some opportunity to support energy efficiency through cohesion fund .
but to establish some kind new fund will probably create lot very long debate .
idea , course , i can only support .
subject agreement with andean community country
all they be invite , course .
i think that this particular question be quite difficult .
yes , i can definitely say that this be commission poss approach .
this be really big achievement .
so we will try , course , to have this multilateral approach .
subject removal pmous from eu poss terrorist list
what be position commission which should safeguard rule law in this respect ?
in particular , reason for listing have not be communicate in advance decision .
organization be therefore not in position to make its view know before decision be take .
i should like to thank commissioner .
let i make it clear that i condemn terrorism in all its form .
i assume council and or european institution will follow court poss decision .
but i have not be inform that we have have any reaction from iranian government .
on contrary , colleague say that there have be no reaction from iranian government .
that seem to i to be good step .
this list be , course , constantly be revise .
so this be process which be dynamic it be not fix forever .
there must be reason for any new approach , but it can be revise if there be new reason .
subject future eu iceland relation
we could not have imagine discuss potential radical change in eu iceland relation .
commission be closely follow this debate .
i can assure you that we will handle application as expediently as possible .
such move would not have positive impact on eu iceland relation .
how would union be able to deal with such request quickly , if this could be do ?
negotiation will be same as with all or candidate country .
i do not see any possibility have some kind fast track for se negotiation .
wher iceland be , perhaps , quite well prepared for membership be another issue .
this be my opinion .
there have never be any talk in commission any special treatment or fast track .
se be both quite specific question .
concern fishery agreement , again , this be very specific question .
however , i seem to remember that this issue be mention several time in previous enlargement negotiation .
i think this will be key element in future negotiation .
thank you , commissioner , and thank you for help we this evening with so many question .
subject demography report
se be describe in attach survey individual country .
however , commission may act as catalyst for change , to support effort member state .
thank you for you answer , commissioner .
you talk about need ageing population .
certainly care give be one those .
you mention that family carer come within remit member state , and i agree with that .
you also mention in reply to i that european social fund could be use for training .
i would like you perhaps to elaborate more on that .
as for funding for se people , that be matter for member state .
this be one reason why we be aim in this direction .
task be simply too difficult and they can not cope .
we wish to take action on this issue too , through european social fund .
as author be not present , question 51 lapse .
subject poverty in european union
since then , union have set up instrument for achieve that goal .
this cooperation between member state have have very good result .
all relevant policy have therefore be bring to bear in fight against social exclusion .
renew social agenda also propose strengn open method coordination .
i would like to thank commissioner for he very comprehensive answer .
very often , in economically difficult time , young people unfortunately get into drug abuse .
this depend on decision individual project sponsor , local community , and decision at national level .
sit be suspend at 7.30 p.m. and resume at 9.00 p.m.
protection minority in europe debate
be european union credible when it condemn violation human and minority rights in third country ?
we can not sweep se problem under carpet !
citizen europe expect we to provide genuine answer .
subsidiarity and self governance , power share and joint decision make be fundamental value european union .
copenhagen criterion be aim specifically at candidate for accession to union .
however , union do not have general power in area protection minority rights .
adoption framework decision against racism and xenophobia on 28 november be further example .
union have also act concern situation roma minority .
integration immigrant be important and grow issue for member state european union .
european commission poss policy on multilinguism include regional language as well as language speak by minority .
respect for linguistic and cultural diversity be one cornerstone european union .
this will allow we to update report on racism which deal with year 200that be what i can tell you .
in or word , we do not have legal basis for organise protection minority .
likewise , migration have take place both at individual level and with movement entire ethnic community .
we have inherit result all this .
acceptance treaty would be great step forward in history european union .
it can not abandon minority at this time crisis .
nearly tenth eu citizen currently belong to national , linguistic or ethnic minority .
some , like myself , as swedish speaking finn , be treat well .
or be discriminate against or disavow .
immigrant require special support to help they integrate into they new homeland .
russia poss involvement and propaganda in estonium and latvium , for example , be cautionary example .
we must not put weapon in hand those who want to harm we .
it would also be important for this parliamentary committee to be give explicit responsibility for issue relate to minority .
this parliament should approve statement on rights minority .
they share this view .
i believe that roma need more support from state .
in particular , they need assistance with vocational training and with education in general .
member state should play lead role regard integration this and or minority group .
common union legislation would be very helpful to we in we endeavor , however .
however , in many country , this respect be weak or non existent .
this lead to discrimination in which minority be abused and relegate to poorest circumstance .
this negate purpose agreement .
hungary be indeed where ethnic minority have be almost completely eliminate over past decade .
word former ombudsman for minority in hungary , jen√†?kaltenbacha , confirm this .
in those school , slovak be teach for four hour week .
in hungarian minority school , language instruction be exclusively hungarian .
slovak be teach as supplementary language for few hour each week .
on or hand , only hungarian priest officiate in hungarian community in slovakium .
such attitude need to be unmasked and vigorously condemn within european parliament as well .
they live within european member state while never have move from they ancestral land .
this be why eu regulation be necessary and why assistance eu be necessary .
with recent enlargement towards east , situation have , unavoidably , become far more complex .
it have its own characteristic and suffer greatest disadvantage all minority group any kind .
each social group be different .
hu mr president , one out every ten european citizen belong to national minority .
many they feel that they be stepchild within they own homeland .
they look to european union to guarantee they rights and help improve they situation .
ratification lisbon treaty could improve situation , but in itself , it be no magic solution .
this would give clear signal that minority be also full citizen unifying europe .
europe can not have stepchild , since in one sense or another , all we be minority .
in country former communist camp , principle non intervention be supreme .
face with poverty or danger , some people flee they country origin to seek refuge .
right to asylum be way for people to vote with they foot .
in this instance , duty be to accept rule , language and custom receive country .
right asylum be precious right as it be right inherent to human be .
even if you belong to minority , this do not legitimise creation community right .
you ultimate allegiance must always be to country in which you settle .
over time , this will only create either field indifference or field for battle .
you should either love you receive country or get out .
that be duty which be bear freedom to come and go .
we do not need either to adopt provision council europe .
specific mention must be make about roma minority .
it could cause enormous human unhappiness .
mr president , i would like to thank mr tabajdi for he excellent work .
it be regrettable that we be not able to conclude we debate with resolution .
i be firmly convince that minority rights must become part acqui communautaire .
unfortunately , commission be very reluctant to suggest any measure in this field .
let we not forget that respect for , and protection , minority be one copenhagen criterion .
commission do not even apply criterion properly during accession process .
hu thank you very much , mr president .
there be few political territory within european union where double standard be in effect .
we often witness strengn assimilationist effort allegedly in minority poss own interest .
establishment internal legal standard to protect legal status minority be unavoidable .
perhaps method open coordination may be helpful in this regard , until legal basis be create .
finally , i would like to thank mr tabajdus for he excellent work in this area .
romania have allow its minority to enjoy national rights which extend beyond relevant european standard .
indeed , presence in this chamber romanian mep who be ethnic hungarian be live proof this .
european project be about integration and not about create enclave base on ethnic criterion .
this be loss to representative democracy .
speaker continue in basque
eskerrik asko jaun andreok zuen laguntzagatik europako hizkuntza guztien alde .
yet , for sustainability we multus ethnic society , be there any alternative to higher education ?
real life example show that solve issue relate to education fuel strong community development .
education be , by its own nature , unifying rather than divisive .
in fact , it teach we that we be all someone else poss minority .
where need arise , higher degree education in language minority be part national educational system .
let i give you example sapientium university in romania .
ro council europe be institution which deal with respect for human rights .
protection migrant minority be part principle promote by social europe .
no one ask they wher they want to change nationality or adopt new official language .
se traditional national minority be most loyal citizen they respective country .
they loyalty have be unbroken .
my country , romania , have be in existence in its current form since 19re be several or member state besides romania that have similar concern .
i therefore fully support elaboration comprehensive regulation for protection minority rights at european level .
i also want to tell italian minority who live abroad that they would otherwise not have this possibility .
mr barrot speak today about non discrimination .
for this reason , we need positive discrimination in certain situation .
this , i believe , be new idea , idea that need to be pursue .
european union have competency .
i would be happier if representative se minority say that they be well treat .
we must work towards unity in cultural diversity .
in such case , it be indeed immense challenge for single country .
we owe equal rights to all european citizen , irrespective they ethnic background .
they enjoy extensive political and social rights , identical to those enjoy by all citizen .
this be obvious and welcome approach .
i would like to give you example where reality contradict assertion be make .
we be talk here about community more than 100 000 romanian .
this would be second church for romanian live in serbia .
for he audacity in construct first one , far alexandru be give two month suspend sentence .
i believe that romania offer model good practice for very many country in european union .
parliament must take responsibility for elaborate and adopt framework regulation that be binding on all member state .
cultural and linguistic diversity must be preserve , as it be basis for healthily function union .
fr mr president , i have two question for commissioner .
this , course , require clarification .
thirdly , mr beazley raise question double standard .
it be true that , despite problem , situation hungarian community in romania be better .
there be problem in romania , but situation be better than in alsace or brittany .
fourthly , let we talk about territorial autonomy .
at end day , satisfied minority be factor for stability in country europe .
that be reality and i would like to thank you for debate .
mr tabajdus have just list whole raft problem .
open method coordination have be mention , but this method too require we to have competence .
that be as much as i be able to say .
i can not go any further , because we do not have legal tool .
member state will not allow we to .
in wake this summit , mr ≈°`pidlum be go to establish european platform on roma .
this flexible structure will allow we to rise to challenge at eu level .
i would like to conclude by say that i have be touch by what have be say here .
that say , there be nothing to stop country informally exchange good practice or best practice .
no country in contemporary europe deny rights minority .
it appear that europe be one mind on this .
nowadays , anyone who query rights minority will certainly not succeed in world politics .
article 11 latter provide for use minority language , include on street sign .
i have be chairman arad county council and romania west regional authority .
rights national minority in eu member state constitute important issue in term human rights .
this provoke reaction by majority .
this have happen , for example , to pole in germany .
case people who have arrive in we country from outside europe be quite different .
clearly , se individual have right to they own culture and language .
vote rights for non citizen latvium in local election debate
this be aberration in european union .
this be not acceptable .
we have examine specific case in committee on petition .
i do not have another passport .
i do not have another country .
i only have this country and i can not vote .
that be aberration .
how be that possible ?
recommendation european parliament and numerous or institutional organization have be completely ignore .
large part latvium poss population have be alienate from state and its institution .
no wonder naturalisation rate be slow .
they do not participate .
they do not take decision .
be this situation good or bad for european union ?
democracy can not flourish without civil society , and there be no civil society without participation .
participation begin at local community level .
eu must take action on they behalf .
why do commission not act on this ?
this do not conform to european union , its principle or its value .
se people be call non citizen .
this be , quite simply , unacceptable .
i do not believe it should be tolerate .
those language be simply ban .
today , reality be that they be co official .
i take exception to that .
commission be aware specific circumstance in which russian speaking minority in latvium find themselves .
commission therefore can not talk to latvium regard issue se people poss participation in local election .
it be up to member state to decide such issue .
when speak about russian speaking non citizen , one can not use concept atraditional minority .
why that be , i do not know .
what do that mean ?
mr president , commissioner barrot poss response be very disappointing .
i would have expect more positive response from he , despite legal constraint that he operate under .
i be from ireland i speak english .
english be my mor tongue , but i be not english i be irish .
reality be that european union be make up many state .
we must encourage they to participate politically .
one largest migrant community in ireland be british .
they can all vote in local election in ireland .
such position be also in line with international law and practice .
latvium aim to have citizen with full rights , instead have non citizen with many rights .
majority latvium poss business belong to russian entrepreneur .
se be argument that permit we to reject complaint against latvian state .
let we not therefore prevent they from live in they world past value !
latvian non citizen be not national any state and they have no right to participate in any election .
this be unique case in parliamentary history .
commissioner speak only integration non citizen into society and they naturalisation .
latvium be invade by stalin , then by hitler , and then by stalin again .
latvian population be then subject to imprisonment , deportation and execution .
stalin then import not only russian speaker , but ukrainian speaker and belarussian speaker .
i think that be important , not just for latvium , but for all we country .
do not ask for privilege if you do not want to play you part .
you can take citizenship .
there be palestinian exile who take latvian citizenship .
if he could learn language , i be sure that those russian speaking latvian can do same .
course we be remind that great majority have take citizenship .
if you be part country , i think you have rights and duty .
hu i wish to congratulate alexandra dobolyus and she fellow author .
this be one most serious human rights issue in european union today .
i be well acquaint with practice , but nothing can justify historical revenge .
well , that be quite sad .
historical compromise must be find between latvian majority and russian minority .
this be only solution , there be no or .
latvium poss citizenship law be one most generous in europe .
any non citizen can acquire full rights , include right to vote , by become citizen .
they arrival be direct consequence occupation latvium implement by soviet union .
sv what be consequence for latvian people fifty year soviet occupation ?
why do large proportion russian speaking population not want to apply for citizenship ?
what be russia poss part in all this ?
compulsory schooling involve learn language country and possibly or language .
in addition , student learn about history .
compulsory schooling , as we understand it , help people to live toger in harmony .
this be purpose serve by good compulsory schooling system .
mr president , i have listen carefully to both side .
unfortunately , that be all i can say .
sit be close at 10 55 p.m.
sit be open at 9 a.m.
action take on parliament poss resolution see minute
procedure in horizontal committee be new .
that have be greatest advantage this committee .
we know very well that prohibition , sanction and do without achieve very little .
instead , we must encourage change in awareness as well as innovation and motivation .
report be also honest .
we have state that we do not have any super weapon .
report be therefore direct at we all .
that be wonderful thing about it .
i be particularly pleased about that .
nor do it disparage any area .
amount will increase , and we must work on this to bring about innovation .
i just say that we should involve we citizen so that they can do something in they own house .
if we understand that , then this task have be worthwhile .
its tireless effort have greatly contribute towards shape eu position on climate change .
as you know , work during presidency will focus on international negotiation process .
copenhagen conference be now only 10 month away .
this encompass further mitigation effort , adaptation action and finance and technology mean to make that response operational .
i have speak on phone to carol browner , president poss assistant for energy and climate change .
last year , we priority be package measure on climate change and energy .
we effort bear fruit and we can now be proud this very important package legislative act .
you report have therefore come along at right time .
one illustrative example be proposal which commission table recently on energy efficiency building .
noneless , i believe that agreement will be reach in copenhagen .
we can and must reach agreement .
there be no time to lose .
it be question political will and i think that will exist .
one illustrative element be measure announce recently for car .
comparability will be decisive importance both in achieve environmental target and in safeguard fair term competition .
commission have propose series criterion for define comparability .
this mean that we shall obviously be expect more from rapidly develop economy than from or .
furthermore , one part need to be public funding and we must examine way secure se public fund .
today , in midst recession , this will not be easy debate .
international negotiation will proceed apace and intense diplomatic work will be need on we part this year .
i welcome you contribution to this major effort .
we discussion be quite dynamic at time , precisely because diversity view express .
personally , i think that it would be good idea if we pursue this particular methodology .
however , that alone will not be enough .
in this regard , we need to achieve much more when it come to information campaign and awareness raise .
i also agree with comment make about correlation between financial crisis and climate change .
since we objective be to limit global temperature increase , we also need to work internationally , course .
it have , in my view , become all encompass report with nearly 200 recommendation , and really worthwhile .
i would like to mention five core me that be really essential for we group .
all se area deserve we full attention and effective solution .
secondly , climate policy should also have social dimension and should show solidarity .
we need to address employment , income aspect and energy poverty .
we need to know how new technology will be pay for , and who will bear that cost .
we want to know how many job will be create and wher any job will be lose .
we want retrain program for new green poll worker .
without maximum social dedication , it be extremely difficult to maintain political support for climate policy .
we third core me be relate to economic crisis , where we once again need comprehensive solution .
green new deal have now become concept , and one that receive we wholehearted support .
considerable investment be need .
intervention to support bank and business should at least have sustainable component .
we fourth core me be agriculture .
this be usually not something we discuss when we talk about climate .
what be also clear be that agriculture do not only pose problem , it also offer solution .
sound agriculture , effective land use and appropriate use biomass can help reduce greenhouse gas .
we fifth core me , finally , be about involve people .
this require provision information and transparency .
local initiative be very valuable in this regard .
free energy audit for house , better public transport and local and regional food production .
toger , we can achieve great deal .
with this set measure , there be also reason for optimism .
i be indebted to all fellow member who have make contribution to this .
it be fact that human population be grow at unprecedented and unsustainable level .
in lifetime many we here , population on this planet will have treble .
it continue to grow at rate 200 000 every day 80 million year .
why do china need new coal fire power station every week ?
minister be fly to india today .
population growth be even faster there and again they be turn to coal for energy .
contraception must be available for all .
woman must have control over they reproductive life it be so preferable to alternative unsafe abortion .
we refusal to place it there be greatest folly .
family everywhere should be talk about this .
government should be set target for population stability or reduction .
we need to reduce bureaucracy and support sme and technology developer .
market be there .
regulatory framework be clear .
we have set target for renewable energy .
although funding be scarce , it be crucial to technology development and to maintain expertise .
bank and funder will have to take risk on green technology start up .
there will be long term gain if we step up to mark .
job and wealth will flow .
for example , ireland could become to ocean wave technology what finland be to mobile phone technology .
we have undisputed potential due to wear and location in atlantic .
we have technology patent .
we have expertise in situ and we have legal target framework .
delay at this point would be detrimental .
green technology be we future .
we have opportunity now , so let we use it .
length report be evidence huge number issue there be to deal with .
i can see that any legislation at european level relate to this issue will be establish new ground .
i would like to mention three thing in particular .
we be also demand measure to be take in respect meat industry .
large proportion this feed be export to europe as soya .
this be not sustainable .
car industry be another grow problem .
between 1990 and 2005 , emission from european transport industry increase by 32 % .
huge investment in public transport and or environmentally friendly transport be need .
we need to ask ourselves wher situation with all se form transport be sustainable .
should we not encourage local production and consumption instead ?
if they be adopt , my group will be unable to support this resolution .
therefore , please vote against amendment 12 and 
we should not , therefore , get too bog down by short term event .
to reduce or prevent negative effect climate change , tough action be need across wide area .
we need tough goal for period between 2020 and 20not one section society should escape make effort .
this report make particularly valuable contribution towards this .
mr president , 500 year ago there be consensus amongst learn man that world be flat .
they be wrong .
they be wrong .
weapon system would fail , commerce would stop , aircraft would fall out sky .
they be wrong .
nothing at all happen .
today we be tell there be consensus around catastrophic man make global warm .
it , too , be wrong .
nor be it consensus .
ice cap have shrink on mar , yet nobody imagine that industrial emission or 4x4 be to blame .
latest set measure be recently approve energy package .
report that we have before we be , as have already be say , set recommendation .
only way we can be really effective be to improve efficiency .
i would , however , like to focus on content .
i have here some statistics on we work .
i personally would argue that it be success , if only modest one .
at present equal condition that will convince people in develop country to espouse this policy be still lack .
it be somewhat too eurocentric and somewhat too compartmentalised as well .
we be look at lifestyle change .
it mr president , lady and gentleman , my compliment to president florenz .
we be fail in not bring sufficient ambition to this debate .
latest science tell we we need to be reduce emission by around 9 % year on year .
target set out in this report and in eu poss climate package be simply not ambitious enough .
we be fail in not bring enough urgency to this debate .
we be fail in not be consistent .
today , we speak renewable and energy efficiency .
that debate urgently need to be begin , and eu be very well place to start it .
se reduction target can not be meet without serious diminution in food production .
twenty per cent by 2020 be start but only start .
with obama presidency , we have opportunity to stop exchange word and start exchange idea .
we hear that meeting will take place on 6 march 200with unite state , we can now move to that 30 % target and beyond .
we need to move on to shipping and to agricultural emission .
commissioner have refer to urgent need to talk to low income country in develop world .
they will be devastate , but they do not cause this problem .
devastation will come to agriculture .
they must take action , but they need we help .
i may be wrong about possible flu pandemic .
i may be wrong about probable impact global warm .
however , majority scientist may be right majority politician may be right .
many be sceptical about wher committee on climate change will bring add value to parliament poss work .
that lead to credible result , as we can see .
mindset in european union have long be that we need action to prevent climate change .
we have , however , lack financial instrument .
sv this report promise great deal .
no measure be propose with regard to protection land and soil .
alternative fuel be also treat with far too much restraint .
there be option here , too .
in this regard , we need to come up with more with regard to growth and job .
it be , course , possible to create job in europe .
they be need here .
we need to anchor measure in economic policy .
we must create basis for development in field energy .
do you not understand this ?
it cover all major area social life that have bearing on dramatic increase in climate change .
it be high time for we to prepare necessary measure within eu context .
situation in agriculture and in secure sufficient food for human consumption will also become very serious .
to my climate sceptic friend , could i say that precautionary principle should be consider .
i would recommend it to they .
i should like to thank karl heinz florenz for he report .
they have all do excellent job and provide good basis for work in future parliament .
report before we be long it make many point .
so we have to get this package measure right .
dorette corbey talk about what can be do in way energy efficiency measure .
climate policy can not stand alone , but need to be incorporate into all we legislation .
there be not much time leave .
we have now adopt we climate package within eu here in parliament .
this be something that government eu need to take note .
we need to think long term .
extra quota for industry , while foster its competitiveness , noneless make it difficult to obtain funding .
this could be do by centrally cover part cost make change .
europe must act as pioneer and take charge realistic , necessary measure on international basis .
this be completely short sight .
madam president , we have here ambitious plan .
plan to do nothing less than save world big job at best time .
this simple statement be first to be attack and remove .
what be so objectionable to committee ?
because creation have creator .
it do not matter to i how universe be create , or in what time frame .
well , all i can say be good luck with it , and may god spare we .
i do not want discuss detail this report .
in my opinion , it should simply be adopt .
during numerous month discussion on subject , far reach amendment be make to this package .
this have be we great achievement .
commissioner , it be excellent decision .
we must now speedily examine it in parliament .
another very important issue be fact that we need to base we work on global agreement .
that be assumption behind mr florenz poss report .
that be what be most important to we today .
problem now be to find out how we can implement all report poss recommendation .
we must urgently find means fight global warm .
european commission estimate that annual investment eur 175 billion be require to fight global warm .
with budget eur 76 billion , we be wide mark .
we must face up to consequence climate change there be no question about that .
it be only means for do so choose by report that i can not fully support .
europe lead way be not enough to convince rest world .
secondly , with we current level knowledge , renewable energy can not completely replace fossil energy source .
it may be motivate on political level to demand that , but it be not realistic .
political will , as great as that may be , will not nullify any physical law .
thirdly , biofuel be hail as environmentally friendly alternative .
fourthly , means mobility that protect resource in long term be reasonable goal .
unfortunately , german liberal can not give they support to this .
however , global warm have always start dozen or so century before any increase in carbon dioxide level .
if we acknowledge this fact , mankind would save billion dollar by give up pointless activity .
money save could be spend on fight against poverty and on new technology .
what climatic masterstroke .
madam president , mystique border on religious creed have grow up around this allege global warm .
global warm ory have cast co2 , natural constituent atmosphere , as demon gas .
it do have effect slightly trap heat around world , but how ?
you need to draw graph show how co2 perhaps cause warm .
we be nearly on flat line , if not already there .
extra co2 will have no more effect .
there be no problem .
madam president , i would like to thank mr florenz .
this be rich report with great number concrete proposal .
all se factor will accelerate warm .
we can control emission but we can not control se factor .
that be why some we advocate very strongly 350 ppm target .
this dimension problem be refer to in report but only in pass .
i would have like it to be at core report .
finally , let i just endorse what guido sacconus say .
what be need from we today ?
climate change be bring about broader democratic participation by society , society which live with different cultural value .
answer lie in make economy green and make business , household and government sustainable .
if they want qualification for worker , they be up against policy that be very compartmentalised .
this report call for integrate approach that also hang toger territorially .
fortunately , my amendment on use region and city have be adopt .
they will be follow conclusion this report , close to citizen and close to business .
this be right approach , in my view .
as such , this approach can count on my backing .
i be oppose to over simplify approach towards agricultural sector in paragraph 189 , though .
as such , we will oppose this paragraph .
there be also massive uncertainty which mean that security be so important .
however , we must also look to future .
however , commissioner , madam president , we still have challenge put it across to we citizen .
de madam president , florenz report actually contain lot good suggestion .
this be show very clearly in report along with many opportunity for new technology and economic development .
however , i think it be shame that we have exclude large area science .
corresponding application be reject by majority , and that be that .
science be only what fit into political concept .
this will not work , because science do not allow itself to be manipulate .
thus , report will , unfortunately , hit rocky ground in end .
and anyone who demand protective clothing against effect climate be deliberately stir up anxiety .
i hope that se radical and misplace ideology will not be include in report .
today we have in front we final report to be put to vote .
through committee poss method work , this report have also succeed in achieve horizontal viewpoint .
fight against climate change can not be wage by europe alone .
we must also get or continent and country on board .
when we talk about adaptation measure then we be also talk about funding .
water play central role in climate change .
until now rainwater have be regard as waste water which have to be dispose as quickly as possible .
new approach for water be base on principle that rainwater be key to life .
i be delighted that it will be introduce by expert group czech and slovak scientist .
this be interesting approach , minister bursc .
i believe that it will win you support .
it be important not to give up on such complex problem .
we face challenge and we must act now because we action today will determine we future .
we will prevail only if we give green lightto all progressive solution in europe .
resident lithuanium and or baltic country really thirst for european electric energy network .
call to increase structural fund money , use to heat multus apartment dwelling , be very important .
miracle rarely happen .
let we go beyond discussion .
let we make sure that member state make solid commitment .
yet , there be something we should be worry about .
2009 be european election year , when european commission will change .
it be way reduce energy bill , which will please consumer .
yes , fight against climate change be one response to economic crisis .
i have recommend development greener form tourism such as sport tourism or cultural tourism .
i feel that we must consider create international fund for plant tree on unused landmass .
what be need ?
every initiative we have launch must be speed up .
it be not enough to talk about se thing we must make they reality .
what sort thing , for example ?
common european airspace , single european sky and we management system .
above all , we must deal with we city and or difficult area .
ultimately , this be perhaps most difficult task .
unfortunately , i find no fact in that report , only belief in infallibility ipcc report .
agriculture be particularly affect by climate change , as its product be produce in open air .
agriculture be often depict as big cause climate change .
this show that agriculture should not be depict as environmental villain .
energy be another important area in which agriculture contribute to fight against climate change .
for example , agriculture in austrium consume approximately 2.2 % energy generate .
proportion renewable energy be 23 % , large share which again belong to agriculture .
great importance must .
we greatest challenge now be to establish next international climate treaty .
climate protection can be accomplish , but measure need to be swift and consistent .
madam president , i would like to thank rapporteur .
report would perhaps be better without they .
neither one country , nor union can separately and independently handle challenge climate change .
therefore we need to integrate policy on horizontal and vertical plane .
policy , legislation and finances must work together .
report provide fantastic platform for this .
without this we be leave to triviality and mundane .
i appeal for invest in science and designate climate change as important priority for all eu scientific program .
transport sector must reduce co2 emission by 20 % by 20therefore , i would like to urge state to apply tax incentive and encourage people to use public transport .
in france , we speak ath√†?odule committee .
i wonder about future this report from point view its integration into european policy .
no sooner have it be adopt what be more , unanimously this excellent report be bury completely .
perhaps if we have introduce it into european policy , we would not be here now .
i would like to speak to rapporteur , who deny that he be present political project .
so , yes , we must be more ambitious and we await result .
we have lot expert in committee , that be true .
unfortunately , however , they represent only one view .
we do not get chance to hear all side debate .
i think this be mistake .
it make no sense constantly to resort to new regulation and new measure .
only solution can be to sayyesto innovation andyesto research .
in long term , objective will be more compatible .
research have to be undertake in view dwindle stock .
this will result in disappearance whole species .
i be therefore extremely critical part eu poss fishery policy .
definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in fishery sector .
i vote in favor this report .
i vote in favor mr migu?lezreport on fishery research .
we be extremely critical part eu poss fishery policy on environmental grounds .
definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in fishery sector to which extra resource be allocate .
i support report poss intention to facilitate mobility professional and to guarantee safety consumer .
therefore i abstain in final vote on report .
therefore i abstain on final vote on report .
i therefore vote in favor this report .
there be also good reason to seek end to what be refer to asscientific whaling .
it madam president , i vote for report .
observatory help to surmount se obstacle by provide expertise and systematic information to operator concern .
unfortunately , however , often legislation adopt by european community be not sufficiently publicise in italy .
when distribute audiovisual goods there be often problem insufficient knowledge difference in national legislation .
these network help to improve quality observatory poss economic and legal analysis .
it be for member state to become involve in and fund european audiovisual observatory .
employer must not be able to avoid apply labor law rule by utilise complex chain subcontractor .
we believe that people without document be just as vulnerable , even if they be work for private individual .
it be with this hope that i vote in favor this report .
there be absence this type legislation in certain country within eu .
or country have legislation , but it be not implement or observe .
proposal that we be vote on today have many shortcoming .
finally , president barroso , no eu tax , thank you we already have enough tax .
e mr president , i wish to direct my comment to mr barroso .
however , you have just totally surprised i .
we represent many european citizen and you have demonstrate contempt for all we voter .
these proposal do not even include what you yourself have defend during you term as commission president .
unfortunately , president barroso , in democracy you can not please everyone .
some people do not like you because you be too european , and or because ideological prejudice .
or want to postpone decision .
postpone it would create vacuum and would weaken both commission and europe .
world be not wait for we .
world be not stand still while europe set its house in order and elect its leader .
postpone decision would be to accept that europe be irrelevant in more global world .
good luck , president barroso , and success in you work .
now you be say that you will do everything i have ask for .
how can we suddenly start believe what you say ?
in next few week , you will have time to prove that you really take this seriously .
these member will support you tomorrow .
we believe that commission be rather less strong today than it be five year ago .
there , mr barroso , be some question face you .
it be on this basis that we shall judge you future action .
thank you for listen .
we need properly coordinate economic and fiscal policy in europe .
we need collaboration on tax in europe , which will put end to tax dump .
this will represent green environmental revolution .
this allow european union financial sector to invest most profitably in those country .
this cost both they citizen and european commission , as lender this money , dear .
speedier introduction euro in these country would reduce these cost and create stability .
mr president , i oppose nomination mr barroso as president commission .
like caesar augustus , mr barroso be send he emissary to tell irish people what they should do .
mr president , president barroso espouse europe ambition .
national sovereignty be bedrock we value and cornerstone unite kingdom poss democracy .
in eu , human rights wher individual or collective take second place to solidarity for european .
we in ukip prefer sovereignty to solidarity .
what kind rights be these , when they be reject out hand in name solidarity ?
ukip place sovereignty and citizen poss rights above solidarity .
we reject lisbon treaty and president barroso poss vision it .
what percentage vote would you receive ?
what would citizen do ?
they would probably have listen to you today and see that you promise everything to everyone .
hopefully , they would also find out what you do five year ago .
that be when you promise most people very great deal .
i believe that be very , very little .
i want to make that quite clear .
in we opinion , last five year have bring high point and low point .
citizen must lend they support to europe .
fourthly and finally , we want fundamentally new version interinstitutional agreement .
under these condition , five year period office will be positive one .
it would be as simple as that , if it be not much more complicate .
why do we feel somehow embarrassed and divide , however , when ask to support you candidacy ?
let we be frank .
consequently , we european citizen not only lose trust in european institution but also they hope and passion .
in complete fairness , we must also admit that you can not be hold solely responsible for that .
fact be that union require larger budget and budgetary policy craft to promote economic recovery .
we must resource budget by means independent and more progressive and transparent system .
that be not acceptable .
secondly , vote now be different to last time .
mr kelly , i be sorry but this be new procedure but we have to apply it correctly .
it apply only to question to previous speaker , not for statement .
apology for cut you off .
implementation and interpretation issue that have create uncertainty be problem .
in any case , i have say that , if necessary , we can look at revise directive .
you must be aware that problem you raise do not arise in all member state .
on public service , mr hughe ask why commission have not yet propose framework directive .
on contrary , i recognize they .
on gender balance , i be commit to this and my commission have record number woman .
as you know , initiative on that come from member state .
i be commit to do my best once again .
i remember first delor commission have no woman and second have only one .
at one time i have nine woman member commission , which i believe be very important .
regard issue social matter , let we put this bluntly .
let we be honest about it .
i make that proposal .
so i completely disagree .
it be not intellectually honest to attack commission all time .
you be miss target .
it be easier for you , but reality be that we be push hard .
i be commit to social cohesion .
i agree with what mr lambsdorff say before .
that be you choice , not mine .
i want to bring broadest possible consensus and exclude nobody .
we need strong europe , but there be contradiction there .
we be go to reduce you influence .
we be go to weaken you in front member state .
there be contradiction there , so let we be honest about it .
today i have add some complement and clarification , but it be same program .
europe can not work on fanaticism , or on dogmatism .
no party have majority alone , so we have to build consensus in europe .
build this consensus in europe be critically important .
i be commit to that .
be you ?
that be my question .
it be political issue .
you do not have project for transform europe environmentally and socially .
and yet that be , i believe , what need to be do today .
situation be clear .
via portuguese airspace . 728 people be transfer to guantanamo ?
you be minister from 2002 to 200 next decade will decide where europe be go to be .
current lead generation in western europe have holiday from history .
we grow up in peace .
we grow up in welfare state .
but history be knock on we door .
unfortunately , europe do not have culture achievement .
european dream be to retire to french riviera as soon as possible .
may i give you one piece advice keep europe focus on its core task .
remain open minded and do not propose european tax because it will provoke pitchfork revolution against europe .
i have never see demonstration in favor european tax .
it be simply bridge too far and you will only feed public anger .
we know also that he be lowest common denominator among government member state .
mr barroso will , course , stand as candidate without opposition , without alternative .
when it come down to it , we all have very little influence .
you know , president barroso , that this house be very much attach to this issue .
measure take be not fulfil all expectation and be still not satisfactory .
in this expectation , we support you candidature and keep we finger cross for you presidency .
why do you not use plain language ?
now i hear you try to sound as if you have comply with this request .
you have be ask about this before and you have be evasive every time .
sv mr president , europe today be continent define by peace and democracy .
this be not case 70 year ago when europe be at war .
this be not case 20 year ago , either , when europe be divide into east and west .
we generation have responsibility to manage we continent and preserve and strengn open and democratic europe .
mr barroso , you have special responsibility .
we need leadership that listen .
you need to do more in this regard .
here be some guide principle for continuation you work .
protectionism be abomination even for former maoist .
strength eu lie in its open border and free trade .
human rights apply to everyone , wherever they be .
you need to do more in this regard .
free europe poss farmer and give consumer and market chance .
eu do not need more institutional power struggle .
preserve we from that fate !
mr barroso , tomorrow , you will hopefully have opportunity to establish new commission .
i hope that you will then ensure that there be as many woman as man in new commission .
i shall focus on meaning flexicurity , which you often use to combine flexibility and security .
this concept appear to harbor serious danger in term worker protection .
part time employment , for example , be fine when it be worker poss choice .
please god .
that be why i be call on my fellow socialist member to show same courage .
in past , far right extremist conceal they face under various different mask and guise .
today they parade through public square and speak openly to media .
be you that leader , mr barroso ?
so , mr barroso , ball be in you court .
will you meet challenge ?
because you have not convinced i yet .
mr barroso , when credit crunch break , you do nothing .
this be peanut compare to eur 30 35 billion europe ought to be provide .
in so do , you be severely hamper copenhagen poss chance success .
there be credit crunch , economic crisis , climate crisis three test genuine leadership .
mr barroso , three time you have fail to make grade .
many i agree with .
however , you have take great interest in my constituency norrn ireland .
for this commitment i 
we value support and close work relationship commission official at all level with norrn ireland .
i look forward to this relationship continue and my constituency benefit from it .
you will know about huge potential for economy through development tourism .
as many in this chamber have say already today , it be action and delivery that count .
e madam president , commission president , i want to make preliminary comment .
we should not do thing any differently from what happen in national parliament in this respect .
this be strictly democratic principle .
we be not only experience economic and financial crisis , but also crisis value .
this be first time that i have hear in this house any confirmation these characteristic .
we be not only experience crisis , but also change world .
second point , which i also support , be mr barroso poss european ambition .
crisis be not yet over and its landscape be still unrecognisable .
it be also force we to deal with social inequality in european union .
we therefore need political ambition that you have show this afternoon , mr barroso .
we need europe capable regulate market and guarantee rights , particularly social rights .
i have listen to proposal to include security relate immigration commissioner in you commission .
we need strong institution .
this be why we hope that treaty lisbon will be ratify .
it be tool box that will make institution work .
we need strong commission that can confront crisis as quickly as possible .
third reason be contract confidence that we have sign with you .
we view remain strongly negative .
throughout year you presidency , commission have show itself to be incapable and lack in autonomy .
it be obvious that we can not identify with this majority .
in this respect , important role will be play by agency for cooperation energy regulator .
energy security also depend on eu poss neighbor .
we must support neighbouring country which subscribe to european value and aspire to become part european family .
you show contempt for mepsmemory event .
for this we need industrial policy to be adopt .
citizen need to be set example solidarity in order to combat crisis .
neither in you word nor in you declare ambition for europe will they find this impetus today .
to carry on as before be disastrous , say philosopher , walter benjamin .
this be not only because we be convince you quality but also because we be in hurry .
another matter concern europe poss citizen .
today , this afternoon , word have come up perhaps two or three time .
that be not enough .
finally , over last six week , you have strike i as man with passion and enthusiasm .
you thrive when challenge .
earlier , you refer to union membership and right to strike as sacred .
problem lie in implementation and interpretation by european court justice ecj .
what guarantee can you give we that this will be case ?
institutionally speaking , we be on way from nice to lisbon .
wher these be danger or opportunity depend to great extent on ourselves .
we must give jos? manuel barroso we trust .
if you do not want mr barroso , who do you want ?
we support be not , therefore , blank cheque , but investment .
you can count on vote portuguese socialist .
i wish you good luck and success in you work .
it be , in fact , about take responsibility for europe .
i would like to highlight one point .
mr barroso , i be very grateful to you for mention this again in you interruption .
in this area , we be face with several new challenge .
mr barroso , at what stage be preparation for this institution ?
when will institution begin its work ?
can we expect concrete and effective measure from commission ?
my fourth question be as candidate for president , do you intend to establish mediation mechanism ?
mt madam president , mr barroso , financial and economic challenge have be extensively discuss .
today , however , i would like to focus on citizensright and on citizen poss europe .
all above affect european citizen , as do economic and financial issue .
we have tampere program , hague program , and now that stockholm .
i believe that we must invest renew energy in this field .
stockholm program will open up new opportunity .
be you satisfy with you achievement over past five year ?
can you tell we today wher you be go to do thing differently in you second term ?
be we go to see more same , or something new ?
what do you think you need to change about way in which you go about you work ?
you clearly want to lead commission european union that number 500 million people .
what additional effort will you commission make in order to speed up this process ?
course , we all have different view on that .
that be how democracy work , and that be how we work .
we be confident not only in you , but also in this parliament .
madam president , this vote tomorrow be very much vote about standing european parliament .
good luck tomorrow .
geopolitical framework have undergo radical change .
it represent genuine integration different root and culture .
committee on petition be first point contact between european institution and citizen .
you have already announce creation two new commissioner post .
i applaud you ambition to have conquer , unite and protective europe , as we want .
however , i question european union poss financial standing as regard all you project .
union must have financial resource for its ambition .
some my fellow member have already stress this point .
it be true that crisis be put member statesbudget under pressure at moment .
i know that you be conscious this need , as you address it in you program .
we call upon you to take lead in further liberalisation european service market .
i would like to thank european commission for work with we .
european single currency have prove its stabilise role in these crisis condition .
i wish you success in vote tomorrow .
in order to build this political europe , mr barroso , two pitfall must be avoid in we view .
firstly , that present competition as absolute and insurmountable dogma .
second pitfall to avoid be that turn this commission into mere general secretariat council .
in future , it be we task to build europe together .
i be count on you just as you can count on i .
pl madam president , europe be unite .
it be europe peace , freedom and democracy .
however , europe be also diversify .
common agricultural policy actually sanction two europe old and new .
this require change and creation genuine , unify , unite and cohesive europe .
you , mr president , know this best all .
what action do you intend to take in this area , in order to change this situation ?
it be easy to criticise but we have to give credit where credit be due .
lead 27 different country in pluralist europe be challenge task and you have do it well .
what you have accomplish in five year speak for itself .
i wish you every success .
you do not say where they should come from .
unfortunately i do not get answer from you hopefully i will now .
my question be what about financial transaction tax ?
even mr sarkozy have now propose this , and mr steinmeier and or be talk about it now .
i have one specific comment we know mr barroso poss position on modify policy .
we have not see he position on modify product .
do that mean importation and marketing contaminate product be to be tolerate in europe ?
madam president , i would first all like to wish mr barroso well for tomorrow in vote .
i know it be difficult to try and pinpoint any one individual state .
in this respect , i call for this temporary support to become permanent support .
in this respect , we be face serious problem with environment .
they be now ask for money to overcome situation which we have cause .
this be absurd and truly difficult to justify democratically .
we can not make these mistake with people poss money .
we therefore call for common fishery policy to be revise , specifically base on these new principle .
i believe he be right person for job and he track record have be impressive .
i also believe that eu will operate more effectively if lisbon treaty be pass in my country .
those oppose treaty in ireland be spread scurrilous information about minimum wage to be eur 1.8 people speak green shoot as part economic recovery in europe .
ratification lisbon treaty be green shoot in itself .
investment community and people who create job want lisbon treaty enact .
these guarantee be important to we .
protocol be same as treaty and , course , ireland need europe europe need ireland .
ga i wish you very best luck tomorrow .
de madam president , european union be suffer from dramatic democratic deficit .
unfortunately nothing have change in this respect during last five year under leadership mr barroso .
for this reason , i will be vote you out office .
hu thank you for this opportunity to speak .
i would like to ask president barroso two question .
madam president , i would like to begin with procedural issue .
it be as simple as that .
i go there for democratic debate .
i like democratic debate .
let we be clear on that .
i shall try to respond quickly to large number question .
i will begin with issue bonus , which be last question .
unfortunately , at that time , no one pay attention to we recommendation .
many question focus on energy security those mr saryusz wolskus , mr marinescu and or .
i personally be very commit to these issue .
you can count on i at commission to be uncompromising in my defense european interest .
21st century could well be europe poss century .
i believe that .
i believe that we can manage this globalisation not by force but with inspiration .
europe be world poss biggest export power .
it be american who be now take inspiration from european model .
what be chinese do ?
what be american and or major power do today ?
they be start to talk to we about combate climate change .
as you can see , i can not be as pessimistic as some those who have speak here today .
you all know where this crisis come from .
immediately after , we react .
it be europe that instigate this response .
that be european position .
i believe in fact that we should be proud proposal we have make .
they be on table .
on subject environment , i believe that this commission poss track record be well know .
someone say that biodiversity be not in there .
there read my document and you will see that it be in there .
i believe that we have some good credentials there .
that , once again , be what make europe .
guantanamo ?
i myself do not need advice from anyone on this issue .
therefore i do not need anyone poss advice on how to show commitment to fundamental rights .
thank you , anyway .
that be obvious .
we have unemployment problem that be much greater than before .
lisbon strategy , which some criticise , be actually head in right direction , overall .
there be job creation and growth in europe .
it be global financial crisis that have put we in different position .
that be why i have call for new social ambition .
mr int veld tell i that i have not convince she .
you be very difficult to convince , mr int veld .
i believe , in fact , that we can find fundamental line agreement on this .
i believe that we need industrial base in europe .
i believe that we have means to achieve this .
that would cause division .
we be world leader when it come to financial service .
what be point hand over leadership to dubaus ?
i do not see what point would be .
let we be clear on that .
to conclude , i would like to say something very important to you .
some have say why should we elect you ?
you be only candidate .
be that democratic ?
i myself have very often wonder why i be only candidate .
i lose to ideal candidate from each group .
yet europe be not build with ideal candidate .
europe be exercise in responsibility .
that be reason .
europe be very diverse .
that say , i be no one poss secretary general , and commission be independent institution .
i can assure you that .
i be grateful to all those who have support i i can not name they all .
some they be still here .
i be grateful to you .
you support be not blank cheque .
i think highly parliament .
some say you be too close to government .
i be elect for first time to portuguese parliament when i be 29 year old .
i be politician i be not technocrat or bureaucrat .
i defend parliament and i want to engage with you in this debate .
therefore , you demand can help i and can help commission to do better .

concrete action and procedure have already be put in place to speed up delivery aid .
as v flex utilise previously unallocated reserve fund , it represent additional financing for these highly vulnerable country .
neverless , it be important to recall that development policy be share competence within eu .

mr president , it be great pleasure for i to be here today represent swedish presidency .
presidency and commission will jointly represent eu at g20 summit in pittsburgh on 24 25 september .
we will hold informal european council in brussels tomorrow to prepare eu poss common position .
as you will all be aware , global financial crisis have necessitate unprecedented global measure
firstly , rapid and forceful financial and monetary policy measure to support financial sector and real economy .
overall support to eu economy this year and next year be estimate at 5 % gdp .
central bank have respond to crisis by keep interest rate close to zero .
we be very aware that rise unemployment will be very dominant issue in time ahead .
situation remain uncertain , but it could have be much worse .
g20 have play , and will continue to play , central part in this .
g20 process have have follow significant result
firstly , that we have common analysis problem that have affect we economy .
furthermore , we have ensure that international monetary fund have sufficient resource to meet demand for borrowing .
we coordinate eu strategy mean that europe be lead debate , rather than follow it .
it be we solution that be be note when global solution be draw up .
that be why presidency be invite head state or government to dinner tomorrow evening .
we have only just begin to reflect on these exit strategy .
employment be another major challenge .
extensive work will continue to be require both at national and eu level .
this be very high priority for swedish presidency .
we goal be for pittsburgh summit to make progress on guideline for financing global climate measure .
i want to start by congratulating all you on you election , or there election in many case .
european union have play active and decisive role in encourage g20 in this respect .
all european , as well as european institution , should feel satisfied about all this .
new we administration have also adopt very significant stimulus plan .
for first time in two year , these forecast have not revise previous forecast downwards .
i will come back to this briefly at end my speech .
this have involve intensive regulatory work over last year .
some these proposal have already be adopt here in this parliament and by council .
it must be say that european union be totally unite on this point .
all that be already in hand .
emerge and develop country quite rightly aspire to more appropriate representation .
this be aspiration that european union support , but it must be translate into concrete agreement .
as you know , commission adopt communication on financing climate change last week .
m , commissioner almunium , we be in global crisis .
it be summit where decision have to be take .
this relate to structural reformation in risk management , more transparency and better rule for financial supervision .
commissioner almunium , you say that there be proposal in place for hedge fund .
what do you hope to achieve in this regard at g20 summit ?
you must therefore be bold .
that be most important message this parliament can give pittsburgh delegate .
be bold !
now you need to start put it into practice .
it be good to start with bonus system , but it be not enough .
that be most important task that we must now set ourselves .
nor should you be frighten discuss fiscal policy it be not prohibit .
global transaction tax which benefit long term investor would take we forward in this discussion as whole .
we want number g20 poss element and commitment to be formalise .
m , sweden , have unfortunately also have experience this .
please help we to take advantage this experience .
for i , there be three essential task .
we can not get out this on we own .
europe must hammer home this message tirelessly .
in this respect , we should be wary g20 poss publicity stunt .
ultimately , we want more european entity .
i have several concern .
first be that committee on development in this house draft motion for resolution .
unfortunately , this motion be not pass , although it be write together by all group this house .
second question be about tax haven .
g20 want to tackle it on basis case by case information exchange .
we know that this will not work .
we suggest introduce automatic information exchange so that information really flow between different country .
global financial system need transparency .
in portugal , bank profit grow by 18 % in first quarter this year .
only thing that rise more than bank profit be unemployment .
they should do anything that can be see if they want people to believe in they .
money in we economy have be gifted to those responsible for financial bubble .
reality be that high finance give order and politics obey they .
in unite state as in europe , politician appear merely as servant global banking power .
de mr president , we need democratic revolution .
it be good that there have be progress here .
de mr president , lady and gentleman , statistics be improve .
for that , political will , decisiveness and courage must not fail we on contrary .
today we be talk about g de larosi?there report be too little .
as far as i be concern , debate on pro cyclicity be too brief at moment .
we need to remove procyclic effect crisis and current regulation for 2009 and 20 political will must not fail we .
i have four observation on this matter .
we have see that there be significant support to fulfil this objective .
my second observation be that we must not fall for gimmick .
great deal have happen .
fire appear to have be put out , but foundation we financial system be still shaky .
citizen be unsettled .
financial ethic and responsibility appear , as ever , to be foreign word to many they .
i be expect specific and fast measure from gi hope that eu member state will all pull together .
mr president , so far g20 have concentrate on measure for financial sector .
i have deep respect for small enterprise which , against all odds , try to survive .
they deserve to get loan to which they be entitle .
within eu , we have to look again at statute for european company .
please do not fail to represent at g20 summit view majority europe .
de mr president , lady and gentleman , who should regulate whom and how ?
that will be one controversial question at g20 summit .
there will be argument over bonus and there will be argument over europe poss demand for tobin tax .
however , global economic recovery be also on agenda .
it will be necessary to abide by stability and growth pact in europe , not to bury it .
we must also take employment into consideration .
these be people poss real need .
fr mr president , commissioner , i welcome you determination .
europe have begin to put in place effective regulation , but europe must not find itself isolate .
close international cooperation be necessary , and this be exactly what we expect git must pursue reform , which be initiate at previous meeting , with rigor and vigor .
guide principle must be affirm .
crisis be not over .
strengn supervision and regulation be equally necessary .
obligation for supervision should reflect level systematic risk that financial institution impose on this sector .
furthermore , commissioner , minister , please do not forget in pittsburgh that europe exist .
please make you voice hear above those three tenor .
i have here letter 3 september from three european prime minister .
there be not one word on europe .
you must speak louder than they .
i agree that it be important to regulate bonus and tax haven .
these be all necessary , but inadequate , measure .
it be more important to make effort in term supervision .
we also need to do something about trade .
mr president , i thank commissioner .
i especially agree with he on he charter for sustainable economic activity .
i think this be distraction in many way although it should be deal with .
neither be wish list for solve world poss problem frankly likely to win day .
financial service industry be on fire .
we need first to make sure that we have put out that fire and that it stay out .
for this we need consistent approach .
financial system must once again serve real economy and not continue to destroy it .
we sourn partner , quite rightly , will not accept that they concern continue to remain unanswered .
m , mr almunia , i will give you three idea in one minute .
firstly , we need more europe .
this be because , give global situation , europe must be unite and strong .
if we fail to achieve this , europe will not count and will not be involve .
secondly , we need more state .
this , in my opinion , be urgent issue for future .
finally , we need better market .
i believe this be essential .
on thursday , 27 member council will meet to prepare for gwhen it be matter state aid , breach absolutely must be punish .
it be therefore essential that concrete and , above all , joint measure be adopt at pittsburgh .
fr mr president , you speak governance imf .
what be you position on this ?
my third question be g20 be also part preparation for copenhagen .
what be council poss position ?
what sum will you put on table at g20 next week ?
we national politician be say one thing , but here in eu we seem to be do another .
we economy be still very fragile .
unemployment be rise , and access to finance be huge concern , especially for small and medium size business .
do we want we british or european business to be at competitive disadvantage when they need work capital ?
i firmly believe that we must take action against such trend .
we should subject bank and or financial market operator to proper supervision .
we should prevent continuation damage bonus culture prevalent before crisis .
we must work together on sensible rule to win over we g20 partner .
they be completely at mercy bank , which do not provide sufficient reliable information .
code ethic have be draw up in hungary .
this be extremely important task for europe .
do you not think we should tackle this issue ?
mr president , i would like to thank all member who have contribute to this debate .
many member have raise issue that both i and commissioner have look at .
we hope that supervisory system can be put in place as soon as possible .
we will base this on larosi?there report and see how quickly we can get it into place .
we need more coordinate global solution and effective and function international institution .
we need clear principle for bonus system .
we would also like to take up matter climate financing .
naturally , we will work towards this , because it would be good thing .
we also need global solution .
unemployment be perhaps most noticeable aspect economic and financial crisis to people europe .
we will be have special discussion on unemployment at ecofin in october .
we also have to discuss exit strategy .
it be always most vulnerable in we society who suffer first .
it be hit poorest in world hard .
we have discuss and be continue to discuss how we can ease situation these people .
as result , they would only be counterproductive and would not help we economy .
many member have raise matter hedge fund and new financial regulation .
in summary , naturally g20 summit can not solve all problem that we have discuss .
thank you very much for highly interesting debate .
this be very important issue , which must be clarify by pittsburgh summit .
i believe that this commitment have be make very clear at previous summit .
however , without function financial system , nothing else can be sustain .
finally , i should like to comment on issue that be raise in many you speech .
it be therefore true that not everything have be solve in these six month .
this clearly show that more effective result can be achieve when there be true coordination .
it be expect that approach g20 summit will place predominant emphasis on copenhagen climate talk .
allow i to express few thought i have on this subject .
instead vague long term promise , we need binding medium term undertaking .
these undertaking must be realistic , fair and accountable .
specific financial pledge be need to achieve this .
flexibility mechanism must continue to be give important role .
market base instrument must be give more scope in post kyoto system .
at present , four they have already achieve this .
economic downturn have fuel protectionist ambition , which threaten to undermine operation single market .
mr president , market economy be good slave but bad master .
recently , though , role have become rather confuse .
it be custom at international conference to speak trivia , but now we need action , and fast .
global economy be in need complete renovation and keyword be transparency .
we have to try and do away with risk economy and move towards real economy .
in future , taxpayer should not be make to pay for damage .
i think , however , that we should at least look into how relevant they might be .
this be background against which world leader should operate .
repercussion crisis have be feel by inhabitant almost every part globe .
that be why europe should speak with one voice at summit .
collapse be regard as have actually precipitate current deep global recession and financial crisis .
there have already be step take in this direction .
key phrase here isglobal approach .
i agree with those who speak about need for global co ordinate approach .
this be essential if we be to change power structure global financial system .
this week mark anniversary collapse lehman bror .
it be estimate that it will take ten year for investment bank to be wind up .
transparency be essential if we be to bring consumer confidence back to banking sector .
swift debate
next item be council statement on swift .
mr president , in overall fight against terrorism , key question be how be such activity finance .
in order to do this , we need international cooperation .
that be in everyone poss interest .
this be indeed what will happen .
presidency be convince benefit information from tftp .
allow i to mention certain or provision that we will demand be include in agreement .
we have common responsibility to ensure that crime prevention authority can counter terrorism effectively .
we also have common responsibility to ensure that this take place with legal certainty while respect fundamental rights .
i believe that this meeting allow number still open issue to be clarify .
i would like briefly to underline some aspect .
in short , mr brugui?there say that commitment have be honor .
course , we support presidency wholeheartedly in its effort to that end .
that be what i believe in all honesty .
firstly , there must be balance between civil security and civil rights .
secondly , we need legal certainty for company concern and for we citizen .
we wish you , mr ask , and commission , success here in come week .
these be we thought and we trust that they will meet with broad consensus in plenary .
once transitional agreement have be conclude , we will need to negotiate and conclude final agreement quickly .
but there be some key question leave open .
to which judge can eu citizen or eu enterprise go in case criminal prosecution ?
mr president , after all these warm word , i be go to put cat among pigeon !
why not ?
it be know back in 2007 that architecture swift need to be reform .
why have you not consult national parliament on mandate ?
just come out and say it !
finally , let i deal with transparency .
that be real transparency .
in fact , however , fundamental rights be be erode and proper public debate on they frustrated .
every effort be be make to exclude parliament and hold back information .
this sort untransparent approach be unacceptable for democratic europe .
it be not enough to just tap at door responsible parliament must stop this undesirable development .
presidency must interrupt negotiation until it can guarantee rights citizen and parliament .
we green will have nothing to do with this .
scandal have make european authority sit up and take notice .
agreement have be sign with we government .
expert have make assessment this agreement .
which expert , though ?
we propose amendment to reinforce demand that european parliament have duty to make .
we must go further and call for suspension agreement if principle set out be infringe .
we be count on swedish presidency .
we will continually monitor respect for human rights .
mr president , thank you for these important point view .
i will try to answer some question in short time available .
obviously , it be crucial that information be reliable .
naturally , this restrict how information can be use .
in order for this to happen , we need agreement .
that be what we be negotiate and that be what we have be mandate by council to do .
that be what i have attempt to describe .
i be entirely convince that we will achieve this .
if contrary to expectation we do not , then there will be no agreement .
i believe that in this matter , council have just make its will very clear .
mr president , i have small point order .
i note that once again we be not get reply from council to question that we put .
vote 17 september 2009
eu strategy for baltic sea area debate
next item be council and commission statement on eu strategy for baltic sea area .
we can create new business opportunity and new job , and improve transport link .
consequently , it be important that regional strategy form part wider european policy .
get to grip with environmental issue be , course , one main priority .
this be very sensitive marine environment that be expose to various kind environmental impact .
decisive effort be need , and quickly .
economic crisis have make matter job and growth highly topical .
most country in baltic sea area be small and be dependent on export .
this mean that we must increase integration in order to strengn competitiveness throughout entire baltic sea region .
we aim and goal in this respect be clear .
we must address crisis by increase cooperation and commitment in we immediate area .
global competitiveness require cross border cooperation between country and enterprise , in research and through innovation .
aim strategy for baltic sea area be not to create new institution .
naturally , we objective can not be achieve overnight , but we goal be ambitious .
high visibility this provide for strategy be extremely welcome .
in addition , commission propose to play role facilitator in case difficulty .
responsibility must rest with relevant member state and or stakeholder directly involve on ground .
so what be next step ?
commission very much expect parliament to be actively involve in event such as annual forum .
this strategy reflect fundamental change that take place in this region five year ago .
since 2004 , baltic have become eu poss internal sea .
furthermore , bss be example excellent cooperation between main institution eu .
i would also like to express my special gratitude to commission president barroso .
i would like to make three point .
eu and member state have to agree on provide alternative channel for energy delivery .
first and foremost , it come down to create unite energy system around baltic sea .
however , some question do still arise .
you just say that there be no additional fund .
if so , we need to ask which cohesion policy project already approve will lose funding .
that would be very important to we .
region poss problem can best be solve through cooperation between its people , country , organization and business .
my group be especially pleased that sweden have highlight importance counter trade in human and crime .
we now need baltic sea action plan to end this .
agriculture be mainly responsible for that there be nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from eu field .
nitrogen and phosphorus take oxygen from seabed and feed poisonous alga at surface .
question wher baltic sea be to be clean be largely in hand eu .
commission recognize this in its strategy , but proposal for measure be vague .
virtually only precise measure be to prohibit use phosphate in detergent .
europe have already invest eur 200 million in safety this power plant .
to decommission it today , european state will have to contribute another eur 800 million .
be it right with respect to citizen lithuanium and or state ?
money for decommissioning reactor will have to be take from people hit by economic crisis .
no , this be wrong .
follow this sacrifice , lithuanium will find it considerably harder to overcome economic crisis .
unemployment in country will grow even more and poverty will increase .
lady and gentleman , tell i , do europe need such sacrifice today ?
do we not have better way to spend eur 800 million today ?
lady and gentleman , there be only 2563 hour and 58 minute until reactor be shut down .
sustainability must therefore be include right from planning phase .
this be area with 100 million inhabitant and investment budget eur 50 billion .
we need to proceed very carefully here if we be to make success this pilot project .
pl what macroregion need be coordinate policy sustainable development .
here i would like to underline role then commissioner mr danuta h?bner play in draft this strategy .
this policy be now be continue by commissioner sameckus , to whom i also extend my heartfelt congratulation .
active participation these organization should be very useful in realize these strategy .
i would like to make four point , mr commissioner .
but this parliament remain ambitious , and i think this parliament do want to be involve .
macro regional economic strategy could be way forward in or way , in or place , in europe .
let we hope that this one work well .
baltic sea be suffer two major acute environmental problem .
second problem be overfish .
researcher be entirely unanimous on this .
problem be that baltic sea need healthy ecosystem .
we would also need to prohibit dump cod and this should take effect immediately .
at present large volume young cod that have just arrive in baltic sea be be dump .
i call on swedish presidency to take up my challenge and deal with this problem .
i can see savings in link up local and regional body .
latvium , lithuanium and estonium must be integrate into common regional energy network , include nordel .
we second priority be further infrastructure development .
development transit corridor and communication network will stimulate business and create new job .
effective mechanism for implement and monitor strategy be also important .
it have to be simple , transparent and free superfluous bureaucracy .
regular review introduction strategy and interim report be essential .
first should already be produce in 20us welcome swedish presidency poss active role in get strategy go .
however , not all recommendation this house have be accept by commission .
commission assure we that funding will come from exist instrument , primarily structural fund .
last year , european parliament take negative stance on this .
mr president , it be indeed unique european regional policy initiative and pioneering project .
process preparation strategy have lead to genuine partnership between all they .
development challenge increasingly do not respect administrative or political border .
fus mr president , european union become aware baltic sea issue quite late on .
it be important that we take strategy forward and thus also implement it .
during its presidency , sweden have also integrate these regional policy matter closely with this baltic sea strategy .
baltic sea strategy must therefore be make part common european agenda .
some region poss member state , include latvium , have be severely hit by economic crisis .
we financial sector be interconnect with scandinavian one .
this mean that we problem will create problem there , so this be not national issue .
recently , latvium receive medium term financial assistance for balance payment , provide for by commission .
unfortunately , there be no social condition for such assistance .
as result , government be reduce pension and benefit , but commission tolerate this .
my second concern be about fundamental rights .
without proper financing , however , project will not succeed .
in that case , all this will end after strategy have be adopt .
that be least we must do .
commissioner refer earlier to flagship project , 80 in total .
that raise question how we deal with offshore installation in baltic sea .
that be why investment in treatment plant need to be promote .
one hundred million people live in this region .
it be not intend that any new fund will be earmark for strategy .
however , there be plenty resource in region that we can use .
eur 55 million have be earmark for region under exist budgetary framework .
ki . these concern trafficking area mention by mr j ??
vin mention matter marine environment , agriculture and fishery .
there be number such project here and i would very much like to see more they .
there be also or partnership in baltic region .
naturally , this be something that union will continue to work on .
ignalina plant have nothing to do with baltic sea strategy .
that be old decision that already exist from time lithuanium poss accession negotiation .
naturally it be relate to baltic sea , but it be not part strategy .
baltic sea strategy be internal eu strategy .
it will be what we make it .
danube region and black sea region have be mention in this connection .
i believe that there be great deal to do here and great deal that can inspire we .
i will be unable to respond to all comment and issue raise in debate or in you statement .
i would like just to refer to three broad group issue .
first , shape .
however , it be to be agree in future work relate to implementation strategy .
second point on management and governance .
i think that we should not delude ourselves .
responsibility member state , commission and or organization involve in management .
course we foresee report concern progress make in relation to implementation to parliament .
several member mention need for additional fund for new project etc .
at present , we have more or less three option .
objective must be realize in practice strategy must not just remain fancy declaration .
baltic sea strategy promote by swedish presidency be very welcome .
it could readily assume model function for or european macroregion , like danube basin .
there be , however , one aspect development baltic sea region that demand urgent reconsideration .
this be nord stream sea bed pipeline between russia and germany .
chemical weapon be sink here after world war ius in late 1940 .
election president commission vote
fr mr president .
speaker be interrupt by heckle from right
be you ill or something ?
be you ill ?
as there be problem with vote yesterday , i would ask you to check machine .
it be not such bad idea , be it , lady and gentleman ?
today poss agenda include elect president european commission .
this election will strengn democratic nature we institution .
it be we , elect representative all european region , who will do this .
council europe have nominate jos? manuel barroso as president commission .
ballot be secret .
let we now proceed to elect president commission in accordance with rule procedure .
vote will be hold use electronic system .
i say this because there be many new mep in house .
as usual , in vote you may vote for or against candidate , or abstain .
vote be hold
i would like to say that we have plenty work ahead we .
mr president , i know that you be aware priority european parliament .
for that reason , we greatly look forward to work with you over come five year .
we expect above all to be able to respond to we citizensneed .
congratulation , and all best !
please also allow i on this occasion to say few word to my own country , portugal .
i have official statement .
in view amount work ahead we , we should work as quickly as possible .
this be official statement relate to election mr barroso as president european commission .
appointment to interparliamentary delegation vote
forest fire in summer 2009 vote
today we be face unusually important , but also symbolic vote .
once every five year , european parliament decide who will head another eu institution .
in 2008 , we wait in vain for president barroso to call for order .
this be why i be unable to support you candidacy .
it be difficult for those who have floor to speak with this din all around .
speaker continue in neapolitan
i have no personal problem with jos? manuel barroso .
now , course , there be much doubt about whatsmart regulationmean .
many people believe that smart regulation be bad regulation , or that any regulation be not very smart regulation .
we have go through this house next year alternative investment fund management directive .
how , under those circumstance , be we go to get smart regulation ?
i ask mr barroso to reconsider .
i draw attention to paragraph 3 , 7 and 8 joint motion for resolution .
president barroso have make europe world leader in fight against climate change .
challenge face we be complex , and response must necessarily be holistic .
he do not measure up to task when financial , economic and social crisis occur .
european commission poss policy need to be reorient .
mr barroso be not man for job .
we need directive on public service and reorient policy by commission on pay .
if we want to save we european social model , we need much more ambitious social agenda .
i hope second barroso commission can combine technical competence with thatsome extra .
let we go right way .
this value have be acknowledge by european parliament in this vote .
over last five year , dr barroso show strong , comprehensive leadership .
european parliament have just send out signal that europe be strong and have strong leader .
therefore , with confidence and hope , we can advance towards europe greater prosperity and solidarity .
we would all like to see stronger europe , and for people to be better off !
text you send we do not make this clear .
question be , why not ?
today i vote against mr barroso poss candidacy for three essential reason .
jos? manuel barroso have certainly not further strong europe .
personally speaking , i regret and condemn secret ballot procedure that lead to complete lack accountability .
he must not be in any way advocate for national interest .
consequently , i choose not to vote for president barroso poss reappointment .
i vote in favor appoint mr barroso as president european commission .
i have come to this decision for four reason .
european council unanimously propose mr barroso poss candidacy .
in my understanding democracy , election winner can claim right to choose one they own .
my support also come with some expectation .
i would ask mr barroso to use he influence to counteract this evolution .
failure this strategy be clear .
its foreign policy program make no reference to sahara or palestine .
like 381 my fellow member , i support mr barroso poss appointment as head commission .
europe 12 , kohl and mitterrand , be no more and will doubtless never return .
i hope it will be so and i want to give he credit for this .
to postpone this vote one more time would be to bark up wrong tree .
to wait for phantom candidate would be mistake .
priority must be define pragmatically but without neglect value that lie at origin european project .
big bror europe march on , but apparently no one be to know , and that include mep .
once again this summer , forest fire have devastate south france .
that be fact that can not be contradict .
it do not , however , explain environmental disaster , especially if same phenomenon recur every few year .
we can and must be better prepared .
it really be time member state union take look in mirror .
we political environment can not be one where people close they eye to fact .
this benefit nobody , especially when it concern scale human tragedy result from forest fire .
deforestation be partly due to construction road and railway line .
we must say straightaway that prevent natural disaster and adapt to climate change be not easy task .
for i , two proposal seem essential to improve situation .
firstly , mr barnier poss report 2006 on european civil protection force must be implement in full .
secondly , it be important for commission to have right to oversee what be happen locally .
i vote in favor resolution on forest fire .
that be more than in whole 2008 !
in poland , coefficient threat forest fire be one highest in europe .
in april 2009 , number fire be highest in five year .
we need to set up european reaction force capable act quickly in case natural disaster .
this would be financial and organisational completion action undertake in member state .
today poss debate on forest fire in welcome .
devastation to many site natural beauty be loss to we all .
we must show solidarity with we colleague and help country affect .
criminal behavior should also be suitably punish at national level .
i abstain from final vote on compromise resolution on aftermath forest fire in 200correction to vote and vote intention see minute
financial service signature act
before resume sit , legislative package will be sign to make it effective .
m , minister for european affair , will sign on behalf council .
i be very pleased that commissioner benita ferrero waldner be also with we today .
i have be ask to represent european parliament at dinner head state or government .
we , european union , will be prepare for we participation in g20 summit in pittsburgh .
what be in package ?
these act be aim at stabilise financial market .
there be therefore still reason for parliament , council and commission to work closely with each or .
you will all be present at signing , and minister and i will sign .
we shall now proceed to signing .
composition interparliamentary delegation see minute
conclusion partnership and cooperation agreement between ec and republic tajikistan debate
12475 2004 11803 2004 c6 0118 2005 .
i know that parliament have strong interest in this issue .
tajikistan be important part we overall strategy for central asia .
this hardly accessible country be one poorest in world .
we be already do this through number contact .
now , let we take this as we start point .
europe should have courage to call spade spade .
unfortunately , however , number refute this .
accord to un figure , we have 270 000 victim in european union .
unfortunately , number have be rise in recent year .
in fact , it be definition slavery .
trafficking be today poss slavery .
extreme poverty , family breakdown and domestic violence contribute to some root cause human trafficking .
in uk , we estimate approximately 5 000 victim , which 330 be child .
ecr group welcome this debate .
national government , law enforcement agency and border control agency need to work together .
mechanism for victim support need strengn .
initiative must be robust , member state drive and eu support .
demand be key word as regard combate trafficking in human be .
we really owe it to all victim .
i support question and i would like to add few factual observation and note .
ordinary people usually have no idea enormous scale trafficking in human be .
as matter fact , it be third most lucrative illicit trade in world .
fact that it mostly concern woman and child make this immense business all more inhumane .
demand side deserve strict sanction .
those who profit from exploitation desperate or manipulate people within gray economy must not go unpunished .
those who provide such service and those who use they consciously should also be face with sanction .
sv slavery have not yet be abolish , as many in this house have already emphasise .
this law be important , because through it , society signal that no human be be for sale .
it be time that it be consign to dark recess history .
it be also internal problem .
citizen my country be also be sell to at least several member state european union .
it be very significant and serious problem .
this , too , be human trafficking , and we must not be silent about it .
study have show that profit from trafficking in human be exceed those from drug smuggling and deal .
this kind organise crime have grow with union poss enlargement to east .
also miss be effective prevention and education focus on child and parent alike .
as many as 1 500 website where child be sexually abuse be discover in 200consequently , we have to come down hard on those behind it .
victim human trafficking be most vulnerable and defenceless people , and they need we protection .
we must not send they back into arm human trafficker .
they must be offer residence permit .
it be also necessary to ensure security victim trafficking in human be and they complete integration .
accomplice , organiser or sponsor this terrible crime must not be allow to avoid responsibility .
sk i would like to congratulate author this question , mr hedh and mr bauer .
i be think prostitution , first and foremost , but also child .
very often , we do not want to see it .
in uk , last year alone , 325 child be identify as be suspect victim trafficking .
they find it just too easy to there traffic these child .
this occur all over eu and we must put stop to it .
we be talk about hard to monitor criminal activity here , with very high number unreported case .
sk i congratulate author on submit question and you , commissioner , on you response .
i would like to underline one many topic relate to this issue .
however , it fail to mention that parent should play primary role in protect child from trafficking .
this campaign should alert parent to risk that they child face .
i firmly believe that we can protect child from trafficking only if we cooperate with parent .
unfortunately , parent be not mention anywhere in draft resolution .
too few criminal be bring to justice .
victim do not receive appropriate assistance , shelter or compensation .
thirdly , situation be not be monitor sufficiently .
it be obvious that this problem do not affect only european union .
i believe that it be not enough to simply refer to or reflect on this huge problem .
we therefore need great political will to tackle problem .
here tonight , this great political will have be display , and how !
i believe we can also say that this be problem that must be tackle from european perspective .
it be happen in europe and we must tackle it from europe .
put it very succinctly in she speech .
first be victim protection .
victim protection be central aspect and certainly one most discuss here tonight .
as you say , minister , political will do exist in european parliament .
i believe commission have already do some good preparation work on this draft directive .
once again , i would like to thank all speaker .
vote will take place at february i part session .
often , it be child who be in greatest danger .
accord to ilo , roughly 218 million child be involve in child labor at present .
eu must urgently tackle trafficking in labor market .
currently , law exist in most country but be simply not be enforce .
i should mention that better funding be also require for program intend to combat human trafficking .
it be very important to make distinction between two .
those affect by human trafficking have not take free , inform decision about all this .
they be to be treat entirely as victim .
eu member state must offer victim adequate protection .
woman and child be principal victim human trafficking .
victim protection cost money , and this life save money should be spend wisely .
what be clear be that political will be not there .
apart from political will not be there , police will be not there either .
announcement by president
it concern 18 additional member european parliament .
work on this will continue .
at all event , european parliament be in full control situation .
there be no exceptional situation here , and we be act in accordance with democratic procedure .
permanent presidency european council will present result its work at european summit .
presentation program spanish presidency debate
next item be statement by council on presentation program spanish presidency .
both european society and , above all , we deep seat conviction , demand it .
europe be dream generation , many generation spaniard .
this be what we want to do during next six month .
regard economic crisis , i would like to say follow .
number unemployed have increase by eight million , many whom be indeed in my country .
we need to continue maintain fiscal stimulus until recovery be reality .
we need to commit ourselves to maintain stability pact and fulfil commission poss indication for 20we know what european union poss strength and weakness be .
we do , however , also have strength , and we should remember they .
we represent almost 60 % global development aid , which be great strength for european union .
energy dependency have increase from 44 % to 53 % in whole european union .
do you know what this amount represent ?
we need to change we energy dependency and reduce it , because otherwise , we economic fragility will increase .
progress have be make in field energy , but not progress that we want .
second main objective in modern society , what bring most growth and innovation ?
investment in information society and in new technology that have change almost everything in world .
we want to take step to establish digital market .
what do this involve ?
third area be economy or sustainable industry .
we want to launch and promote , along with commission , plan to develop electric vehicle .
vehicle industry be go to undergo major transformation , which have already begin .
we need to conclude bologna process .
we will be spectator , not lead player .
it strengn parliament , heart european democracy , and also strengn commission .
that be how we shall work .
matter neighborhood relation must be priority .
first these be people poss legislative initiative , which be so important to parliament .
i hope that vote will take place very soon .
commission could mobilise further eur 200 million in longer term aid .
haitus be caribbean country .
i would particularly like to note that latin america and caribbean be priority for spanish presidency .
let i now turn to policy priority for week and month ahead .
everything point in direction determine and unite european action .
only with unite europe can we shape globalisation .
but we have to look at situation we economy .
we all know that european economy be at delicate moment .
determine action have succeed in prevent worst .
at same time , we must learn from crisis .
we fully realize that globalisation be reality and that we need to use it to we advantage .
now we have to shape right future for europe , its economy and its society .
however , i be confident in capacity europe .
i believe that economy rebuild its strength have real chance to redirect its energy .
this will constitute europe 2020strategy .
we need fundamental reworking we economy to meet challenge future .
europe 2020 must offer both mid term vision and short term action .
we need to define together action at european union level to complement national action with positive social impact .
europe poss huge industrial asset need to be there direct to seize first mover advantage in tomorrow poss market .
but europe must be able to retain solid , modern and competitive industrial base .
crisis mean that , more than ever , we must use every euro investment to best effect .
this also include we sme friendly approach .
that be why i have discuss this with council and with president european council .
but , course , this do not exhaust we agenda .
challenge come week and month be manifold .
more we be unite and effective at home , more we case will win through internationally .
thank you , mr barroso .
it be vision development european union , base on community method .
today , we be forecast we role for many year to come .
not everything be find in treaty .
i would like to thank mr barroso for present point view european commission .
now i would like to ask leader political group for they comment and remark .
it be , in fact , matter survival for europe and its social model .
guez zapatero , you know what economic difficulty be .
they be record unemployment almost 20 % and public deficit almost 11 % in spain .
it have to be say , yours be country that be experience problem .
council and parliament must now work in close cooperation and as equal .
you have six month to establish this principle .
best luck to you .
that be right approach and it will take europe into new phase .
we have hold many summit in past .
summit do not solve problem , they delineate they .
what we need be for solution to problem to actually be implement in member state .
reaction to you proposal for economic governance indicate that this be exactly where problem lie .
where do lisbon strategy fail ?
it be not that it would not have be possible to implement it .
no , it be possible to implement it .
lisbon strategy fail due to reluctance member state to keep they own promise .
for this , we need new approach and , therefore , you be on right path .
what europe need be to adopt some aspect spanish model .
you have we greatest respect for that .
i would therefore like to add that we also need more economic control in europe .
that be destroy people poss trust in economic system .
it be destroy social cohesion .
i believe that what you have present here be approach that bring genuine reason for hope .
so , i wish you good luck , mr zapatero .
mr president , lady and gentleman , we have , in fact , two priority for spanish presidency .
i believe you also have , in fact , two priority .
first all , there be post lisbon eu 2020 strategy .
this be , therefore , already major advance .
however we , in this house , have to be serious .
we all agree on this .
it be as if union have become oecd .
that be reality publishing one document after another , after another .
thing must change we need stick , we need carrot .
where need , we must have sanction .
it must be good omen , though !
it be either one thing or or .
one can not have it both way .
we must acknowledge that we approach fail .
we must say it , we must recognize it .
no , it be not right method .
strategy be bad , because result be bad .
therefore , strategy have to change .
i myself suggest that we adopt strategy base on three component .
that mean that there be at least eight european political leader who want to negotiate .
there be not enough room around table though !
there be scarcely room for mr obama even .
how do you expect to agree position and be hear by or in such circumstance ?
let we do like wto then it work for wto .
moreover , we must , i believe , be realistic .
we must be realistic on this matter .
we need trilateral agreement between unite state , europe and china .
that must be aim .
tomorrow poss world be one empire , and we must be empire .
this mean that we must be at table .
with whom ?
with unite state and with china .
at end day , we have to create alliance with unite state .
it be with unite state that we must find common ground .
such common ground can be find , in my view , in emission trade mechanism .
we have that , and they will follow we if we can reach agreement on it .
that will give we common ground in order , together , to negotiate with chinese .
guez zapatero , mr barroso , i would like first to reply to you remark about haitus .
this be during mr barroso poss commission .
if we have have europeaid today , european would already have greater presence in haitus .
mr president , take up michel barnier poss proposal .
you see , i be no sectarian .
i would like now to turn to what you say about europe poss future .
i would like to continue with another me , which mr verhofstadt discuss .
you talk growth , but what growth ?
that be already one issue for consideration .
we in europe must develop major pact for european investment in energy save .
so do not forget renewable , yes , but renewable with energy savings .
we can do it , if we want to .
now to second issue you speak about electric car .
very well !
however , there be another consideration .
mobility be not just about car .
you have airbus , you have tgv .
why not develop major european tramway project ?
in this way , you will be able to give it another mobility relate function .
european tramway project be also solution to climate problem link to traffic .
on different note , you rightly speak education and bologna process .
fine !
problem with bologna process , though , be that it have be divert from its original purpose .
curriculum have be create that student be unable to follow .
i would like to end on you european social pact .
european social pact and social and environmental pact .
bring company , bring union and bring major environmental association around table .
social protection will not work without environmental protection .
if you go down that path , we will be in agreement , and europe be solution .
as for instrument , we shall have to develop they together .
it stumble in its first few day in office .
socialism do not do that .
i would like to touch on foreign policy .
that issue be iran .
its illegitimate , brutal and dangerous government must be deal with firmly .
spanish presidency take office with full agenda .
we group will judge its proposal and initiative on they merit .
if it do that , then it will have we support .
guez zapatero . rodr ?
unfortunately , my group feel that you program do not resolve fundamental problem .
this be actual reality .
on this specific point , there be no innovation .
on foreign policy , we do not agree that we need to increase military capacity .
image disaster in haitus where combat helicopter and marine be be deploy be damage to we .
they be damage !
this be not what be need when there be disaster such as one in haitus .
we need civil protection .
we need doctor , architect and people to relieve pain tragedy .
finally , mr zapatero , summit with morocco .
we do not agree with this summit .
we believe that there should be european summit regard right to self determination saharan people .
mr president ,  .
i will now refer to reality .
as national spain , i be ashamed to see what be go on in my country .
european union have be convince its population that it be there to maintain peace in europe .
be this situation i describe go to bring peace to europe ?
you be tell we that you be go to get europe out crisis .
mr zapatero , we want solution now .
those value be freedom , rule reason , laicism and solidarity .
i would also place more emphasis on defend human rights in world .
without this , everything be hold back and even international policy run risk evaporate like smoke .
i will talk about most important matter , start with mr daul .
thank you for you word regard this positive drive for economic governance , common economic policy .
i would like to clarify something .
it have little to do with my speech , but great deal to do with my political conviction .
i be strong supporter stability pact .
i be strong supporter fiscal balance throughout cycle .
i be therefore convert .
deficit and surplus be tool , depend on economic cycle .
this be not ideological problem .
it be strict in term we public account , and we will put it into practice .
in fact , in my speech , i strongly advocate common energy market and european digital market .
this be something different .
spain have be victim this , as have some citizen , not only british citizen .
this be will government , within its scope competence .
i think this be important matter .
that be my opinion .
mr schulz , thank you for you word .
mr verhofstadt , i be extremely grateful for you word .
i agree with practically everything you say .
with regard to coordination and failure lisbon , open coordination fail .
we be aware this .
government require community method .
there be many decision in workings european union that involve sanction .
also , it work .
i completely agree with what you propose regard copenhagen and subsequent strategy , new strategy .
it be true that europe hold positive position , but that be not result .
mr meyer , with all due respect , there be some thing that we do not agree on .
progressive program be one which see change , one which anticipate they and be capable innovate .
i hope and trust that european union will keep in step with this .
i respect you position on morocco , but i do not share it .
north africa , especially morocco , be strategic importance to european union .
for i personally , it be something worthy  .
i have take note you suggestion , mr andreasen .
in whole my speech , i talk about sustainable growth , environmentally sustainable growth .
it be for we to join force .
join force do not mean control , unite do not mean lead .
on contrary , join force be more democratic , unite promote cooperation .
that be not what we be debate .
these be objective .
course i completely agree i believe that european union have clear position regard iran .
i share you concern and you feeling on this subject .
i fully agree with what you say about energy , which be largely focus my speech .
as we be well aware , energy have determine course history .
it have determine how certain power have dominate or country .
it do so where we feel that offer we hand be better than close door .
we will therefore maintain summit with we neighbor , morocco .
we will , at all time , promote defense human rights .
i would like to express my respect for all they position .
we do not have to go very far .
we receive this report , which have my support and that then presidency council .
now , i believe that answer lie in treaty lisbon .
that be all on first question .
second question concern international negotiation , for example , in wake copenhagen .
it be henceforth commission that represent union in foreign affair , not european council .
without doubt , there will be head state or government who will represent they own country .
who , though , represent union in foreign affair , except for cfsp ?
commission .
let we be clear on this point too .
third question concern economic policy .
here , too , treaty lisbon have to be read .
there be those who think that economic policy be purely national matter .
that be not case .
there be , therefore , joint monitoring .
comment make off microphone
no , yes , course , i have already do it .
i do not need to have you support to say it .
spanish presidency have great responsibility .
both letter and spirit treaty lisbon be very clear .
stronger europe !
thank you , mr barroso .
we have all read treaty lisbon , and we know it do not say everything .
therefore , crisis value have manifest itself before and also during european integration project .
transition be always opportunity .
i be go to tell you how spanish presidency should not be measure .
it be not go to be measure by number meeting that we hold .
measure good presidency be not conventional speech or great word , or common place .
this will be only way that we will truly move closer to all european .
it be crucial time owe to entry into force , finally , treaty lisbon .
those people be watch we , they have expectation we and they be demand answer from we .
crisis necessitate global think and local action , but you need to join force with everyone .
include region , build decision make process with they .
this also mean apply treaty lisbon , which give they role for first time .
you program forget region and do not clarify how subsidiarity protocol will be apply .
do this not seem bad symptom ?
europe will be build by bring together people , knowledge , will and political reality .
e prime minister , welcome .
i be glad that matter energy security have also be include in spain poss priority .
that be illustrative importance which it ascribe to consumer protection .
we therefore wonder what presidency be intend to do about rights its citizen .
do it intend to safeguard they by revise propose full harmonisation downwards or to restrict commitment announce ?
lack vision in social sector be not limit solely to consumer .
young people in particular be in quagmire .
we call on spanish presidency to revise its program so as to safeguard permanent job for its citizen .
further large scale immigration you be advocate can only lead to large scale problem .
guez zapatero , i must compliment you on you eloquence .
however , what do you really have to say ?
what be you message to we ?
i would like to make one thing clear europe can not afford 20 % unemployment rate .
what be so good about this spanish model then ?
how have you respond to crisis ?
how can you coordinate thing here ?
we call for you leadership .
then we will support you .
however , what can we do with something so non committal ?
course we be oppose to marital violence , who would not be ?
he resist opposition council to stability and growth pact .
he be example you should follow .
help he to secure stability and growth pact .
help he to do this and you will have we on you side .
however , with this non committal pie in sky approach , we will not make any headway in europe .
mr zapatero most definitely mention unemployment , include unemployment in he own country .
unemployment as whole be something that worry we .
at its last part session , parliament debate turkey and , in particular , country poss democratisation .
this be clearly reflect in both parliament poss resolution and council conclusion 8 december .
i would also like to mention some or aspect council conclusion .
i will now give floor to commissioner f?le .
i would also like to congratulate he because it be he first day in office .
thirdly , i be delighted that european parliament express its strong support for enlargement in three report .
you report thus reinforce message and support work undertake by commission .
ball be clearly in croatium poss court .
croatium have come long way over recent year but important challenge still remain to be tackle .
we be encourage by recent development in fight corruption .
we hope that investigation into wrongdoing lead to concrete result .
i hope that work task force will soon produce concrete result .
as regard former yugoslav republic macedonium , 2009 be good year as regard its reform process .
it achieve visa liberalisation , and commission could recommend start accession negotiation .
now challenge for country be to maintain reform momentum .
while country meet political criterion , there be still much work to be do .
economic crisis have not leave country untouch .
unfortunately , country be already suffer one highest unemployment rate in europe .
equally important , it will enhance european perspective for wider region .
it be therefore in strategic interest european union .
work on political criterion remain utmost importance , in particular , as regard fundamental freedom .
number landmark reform have be carry out in past year .
some they be next to impossible only few year ago .
this be landmark achievement in civilian military relation .
we will observe closely follow up this conciliation .
we continue to support democratic open launch by government .
success this initiative require participation and support all political party and all segment society .
we also regret arrest that take place in south east at end december .
we condemn terrorist attack that take place at same time .
none these development be really conducive to successful implementation democratic open .
course , it be also croatium poss responsibility , in particular , to take decisive step .
croatium have show that no one be outside law or exempt from measure to combat corruption .
this send out important signal .
i hope that same thing will happen soon in slovenia .
however , there be still some work to be do .
point have already be make that fight against corruption be important element .
however , situation will not change overnight .
mr brammertz have assure committee on foreign affair that great deal be be do .
it may be that some they have never exist .
neverless , i hope that croatium do everything in its power in this respect .
however , i believe that great deal progress have be make in this area .
great deal have also be achieve with regard to return refugee or internally displace person .
there be still few problem at detailed level which be relatively difficult to solve .
it be true that great deal progress have be make in this area .
and that be what i , too , have say in my draft report .
secondly , fyrom be first country in region to comply with all visa liberalisation requirement .
it have also cooperate successfully with international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavium in hague .
last week , fyrom parliament pass resolution on srebrenica .
what be we try to achieve in parliament with this resolution and with my report on fyrom poss progress ?
above all , we want to help .
we want to help fyrom progress along road stability towards european union .
poss war . that fyrom be only former yugoslav republic that successfully avoid milo ?
that be empirical fact and one which can be prove .
balkan today need that .
i stand together with greece .
let we do everything we can to reach this goal .
let we show solidarity with both greece , we fellow member state , and with fyrom .
solidarity must be mutual .
we need to bear in mind that balkan be like bicycle ride .
if we stop now , peace , stability , security and social cohesion would break down .
by way conclusion , let i stress one more fact fyrom have be candidate since 200we all need to be aware consequence we decision or failure to take decision .
i believe that we can only do that if we seek out broad majority together .
i actually have three message for turkey .
i will begin with open debate , democratic open .
mr president , i be therefore call for additional attention to be pay to enforcement .
i will turn now to amendment .
on cyprus , i attempt to reach clear and broad base compromise with shadow rapporteur .
turkey need to know that supplementary protocol that have be agree must be accept without delay .
with this paragraph , then , i be specifically ask turkey to send out positive signal .
this be absolutely necessary .
mr president , we have clear expectation council and commission .
we expect negotiation with croatium to be complete and negotiation with macedonium to be start this year .
however , say that ball be solely in croatium poss court be totally unacceptable .
three negotiate chapter remain to be open by council .
this will allow croatium , if it be treat fairly , to complete negotiation this year .
i wish you every success .
i believe that this will also be case today .
croatium be they homeland , too .
that , however , depend primarily on they .
let i conclude by wish mr f?le , we new commissioner , every success .
i know he will do excellent job .
we be happy to work with you and look forward to we future cooperation .
i would also like to thank mr swoboda for good cooperation on croatium report .
i think there be good cooperation in process and i thank my colleague .
croatium poss quick accession will send out important signal on security policy to entire western balkan .
we in vert ale group would like to see better result in this area .
we would like to see more transparency and less political influence in this area as well .
first concern fight against corruption .
there have be repeat attack on people from these minority group .
we have now receive assurance from croatian government that some these case be be investigate .
my final point be that we have no vision for new energy policy for croatium .
therefore , we would like to call on you to support we amendment we be look forward to croatium join european union soon .
however , candidate must be subject to rigorous and exact standard as lay out in copenhagen criterion .
meanwhile , turkey poss eu membership application remain problematic , not least in field human rights .
we wish to emphasise from outset that we be in favor integration turkey .
we mean this and we believe in it .
as such , we declare that we disagree with position that relevant energy chapter should be open .
i be sure that everyone will help .
however , be this not unacceptably make everyone equally responsible , make victim and occupier equally responsible ?
if we want solution to cyprus question , we must underline turkey poss responsibility .
we must speak openly to turkey , whose integration , i repeat in closing , we support .
effective government measure against grow anti semitism in public life in turkey .
turkish academic recently speak poison atmosphere .
turkey must spell out where it stand on increasingly urgent issue tehran poss nuclear program .
as nato member and eu candidate country , turkey must nail its color to mast .
it must make clear choice .
nl mr f?le , welcome to house !
we do not impose any sanction or next to no sanction on turkey .
i therefore hope that you will all support this amendment .
what be more , freedom press in turkey be under severe pressure .
when i be visit turkey , press be even move on .
we must strongly condemn this and that be why i have table amendment now , lady and gentleman , we come to iran , rogue state .
lady and gentleman , we can but express we disgust about this .
i count on you support .
next , i want to mention negotiation with turkey .
thus , i hope that you will all support my amendment .
european people poss party consider that fyrom go through many positive development during last year .
obviously , we political group would have place greater emphasis on certain aspect .
we need to send out clear message on that point .
course , turkey must also take decisive step on path towards reform .
skopje have carry out reform and be on way to join european union .
we welcome this very much and be very pleased about it .
visa liberalisation be perhaps clearest and most visible sign .
it be milestone in we cooperation .
this objective have only be achieve as result close collaboration with eu member state .
it represent openness , interaction and cooperation .
this momentum be diminish day by day .
in montenegro , for example , existence homosexuality be finally be recognize .
we also all agree that eu must provide all possible support in this process .
bilateral problem , in themselves , should not represent obstacle to accession process .
i be sure that you will also begin process negotiation with macedonium soon .
i hope this will also be this year .
we value fact that croatian unit , as part nato , be present in kosovo and afghanistan .
we new ally have bravely support we fight against terrorism in several nato mission .
this be good objective , and i call upon everyone to support these effort .
let we remember this , too , when we look at we eastern neighbor , ukraine .
where be turkey head ?
be it head towards multicultural europe or towards pan islamic state ?
issue abolition visa , in particular , have outrage secular state in turkey .
neither these promise have be keep .
christian writer and academic be have to go into hide .
i have not even get on to phenomenon such as force marriage and so call honor kill .
what deadline will commission issue turkey with to recognize all member state european union ?
when will turkey have to comply with ankara protocol ?
when will illegal military occupation cyprus be bring to end ?
this context , commissioner , mean that turkish case need to be handle with great caution .
we need to use utmost caution in negotiate process in order not to make any mistake .
mr president , first , could i repeat in public my own congratulation to commissioner f?le .
on turkey , socialist and democrat group remain pro accession , pro reform .
commission poss progress report say that reform effort have be resume but should be intensify .
we agree .
to we cypriot colleague we understand pain injustice you feel .
to or in this house , constructive criticism turkey be need we ourselves be critical friend .
these argument be loathsome and repellent , and so be you .
shrill voice rejectionist must not be allow to drown we out .
i would like to emphasise two thing .
i think that support from population be condition for success in negotiation process .
fr mr president , firstly , i should like to welcome and congratulate commissioner f?le .
12th hearing trial allege assassin hrant dink be hold in istanbul on monday .
this be terrifying and it be crime .
member that family will obviously have to be put in prison .
fact be , few year ago , these crime do not make headline .
these be absolutely crucial element .
i believe that we process must be totally sincere .
first all , could i call for more honesty in we approach to turkey .
i have one or two question for commission .
why be so few chapter open ?
i agree that turkish garrison in norrn cyprus should be much reduce .
it be scandalous that no real progress have be make in open international trade with norrn cyprus .
we do not feel that turkey poss membership be either realistic or opportune for many reason .
i would request that commission look into this and act proactively in relation to it .
i believe that this be happen in current negotiation .
in my opinion , we have make very good progress with croatium and we can complete process quickly .
we must be aware this , so that we do not arouse false hope .
both these thing relate to european perspective , but they use different toolbox .
for this reason , you have interesting job and i hope very much that you enjoy it .
i be pleased to follow my distinguished friend , mr brok , who mention copenhagen criterion .
why be this important ?
i therefore say that lesbian , gay and bisexual rights be non negotiable .
bring in anti discrimination legislation now .
we in parliament should welcome that .
but again , on anti discrimination , i wish they to go further .
so , allow turkey to proceed along this route , on same term , same condition .
if we undermine principle accession , we have no principle leave .
that seem rather strange to i .
however , i would like to discuss subject turkey .
or speaker have say that turkey be society in motion and that be true .
turkey be move forwards and backwards .
let we take example arm force .
that , course , be not good thing .
we think that be very good .
group . private waragainst do ?
all this be very unfortunate .
another example be that role woman .
i do not think that this be case .
i would also like to say something about what mr howitt have say .
however , this be not automatic process .
during this process , we be not only responsible for accession candidate .
we primary responsibility be to european union .
this seem to i very strange .
there be accession perspective , but accession will only come about when all criterion have be meet .
mr president , mr lambsdorff make accusation against unite kingdom .
these be all area which be not exactly marginal .
you say that group green european free alliance want enlargement at any price .
on question macedonium , there have be great deal progress in many area .
i recognize this and i be pleased about it .
that be european law .
you hearing be truly superb .
i would like to assure mr lambsdorff that mr van orden love europe very much .
however , he do not want euro bureaucracy to come between that europe and its citizen .
this could give we certain energy , certain vigor , so it be worth take this route .
europe without that balkan lung be not europe .
this be something which be , truly , very important .
political enlargement with problematic relation with international law be , i would say , problematic in itself .
far still sell they daughter or swap they for cattle .
man who buy wife treat they like slave .
name issue be real political issue in greece .
no greek government can survive if negotiation be allow to begin without agreement on name .
turkey should know how large turkish dossier be for country with its size population .
see last report un high commissioner for refugee .
however , this be issue that be still pend .
important piece jigsaw have yet to be put in place before membership can be accomplish .
on this matter , progress report indicate that there be still much to do .
today poss motion for resolution on fyrom try to mirror this delicate balance .
however , it do not succeed adequately .
indefinite postponement , on or hand , might encourage equally unproductive behavior once again .
some amendment be positive .
however , i would point out that any form nationalism damage its own country first .
greece must strike its own balance .
i have only three comment , since much have be say here already in debate .
my second comment relate to wordcomprehensiveness .
we must give clearyesorno .
turkey be play very negative role in those negotiation .
it can not continue to occupy city famagusta in breach unite nation security council resolution .
that be path turkey be take at moment .
same apply to or candidate country .
when they reform , they be become neighbor .
justice be now area in which hard hit reform be still require .
i stress need to build true legal culture and mentality in line with european standard .
mr president , greet to commissioner f?le .
talk between mr christofium and mr talat be , as we know , at critical stage .
for they to succeed , settlement have to be carry by public opinion .
confidence building be sorely require .
turkey should send signal .
time to act be now .
we wish to speak language truth with turkey .
hu i would like to comment on report on croatium and macedonium .
in case both country , issue concern neighbourly relation have stall progress .
as third member trio presidency , hungary would like to continue and assist with this process .
de madam president , firstly , congratulation to mr f?le on he appointment as commissioner .
it be very balanced presentation progress make in croatium .
it be also important to ensure that freedom press be guarantee .
these reform must be initiate and implement and , above all , they must be support by population .
for that process to take place with mutual understanding , it must be assure high level quality .
however , good intention be not everything .
rapporteur have submit very balanced draft resolution .
turkey have indeed make good progress , but many point concern must be address urgently .
horrible phenomenon honor kill must be stamp out as well as kill transgender person .
just yesterday , we learn umpteenth kill transgender woman in antalya .
turkish government must ensure , as matter urgency , that transgender kill no longer go unpunished .
resolution rightly urge freedom religion and freedom expression .
that be matter credibility and moral authority .
turkey be clearly member european family and be important partner in dialogue between civilisation .
western balkan and balkan have never be stable except during brief era tito poss yugoslavium .
accession to union be only option to stabilise region .
this be very important issue .
i should like to quote another council poss conclusion .
in 2004 , turkish cypriot community clearly express its desire to have future within eu .
madam president , i should like to welcome commissioner f?le and minister .
everybody will be please by progress that croatium be make in completion its accession process .
so , negotiate transformation demand major act political will .
greatest problem adaptation , though , lie elsewhere .
let there be no illusion about this .
that may turn out to be harder task .
however , there be important difference .
may i start by congratulating hanne swoboda on he report on croatium .
we be all delighted that this country will shortly be join european union .
turkey need to honor all its contractual obligation , as all previous candidate country have do .
accession be and must be ultimate objective .
however , we can not have ? la carte accession tailor to turkey .
greek government know that process require new momentum and be genuinely determine that issue be resolve .
we expect equally honest stand from or side .
bg madam president , commissioner f?le , welcome to house .
i wish you every success in you work .
i wish to thank mr swoboda , mr thaler and mr ooman ruijten for they balanced , objective report .
former yugoslav republic macedonium have make progress in meet criterion for initiate pre accession process .
history must bring we together and not tear we apart .
so call hate talk must not be tolerate .
i want to mention in particular schoolbook which child use in school .
they must not contain description incite hostile attitude towards or member state .
i wish croatium , macedonium and turkey every success on they european journey .
madam president , we should continue to support eu membership perspective for country western balkan .
whole process support stability and we should keep up momentum .
last commission report point out that fyrom have achieve progress in many area , and this be commendable .
in my opinion , name issue should not come first .
these people be subject to verbal and physical abuse and even legally persecute for fabricate reason .
it be fact that europe can and have right to continue to enlarge .
in this case , mr posselt , principle pacta sunt servanda apply .
you must be familiar with this phrase which be use by you former prestigious leader .
one further point be also very important to i .
however , one thing be clear .
process will never be linear .
we know this from history european union .
you only need to look at process and procedure relate to treaty lisbon .
there will always be progress and setback in process in turkey .
however , treaty lisbon will also have bring about last change to european union .
we should be aware this .
as i have say , both side must fulfil they undertaking .
that mean complete project unite europe in south east .
we need not only european perspective , but dynamism and stimulation too .
i be particularly pleased that all three country have pay particular attention to develop relation with they neighbor .
similarly , i wish good fortune and great deal wisdom to spanish presidency .
nl neighbor look after one another , they support each or .
when thing be good in neighborhood , they be also good for people who live there .
turkey and cyprus be neighbor .
un secretary general ban ki moon last week indicate belief that solution for cyprus be possibly within reach .
yes , turkey must be make to make effort to bring that solution closer .
that be what we be call for in report on which we be about to vote .
it be not just turkey that have to make effort , however .
ultimately , that be , course , what we all want solution .
croatium be show good level regulatory harmonisation with acqui communautaire .
there be still need to complete program small scale privatisation and reduce state interference in economy .
i would also like to congratulate new commissioner , mr f?le , and welcome he to role .
madam president , i welcome commissioner f?le and i would like to congratulate author for three well balanced report .
there be no doubt that prospect eu membership have push turkey to change for better .
e madam president , may i welcome commissioner .
in this decade , enlargement policy have be european union poss greatest success , along with euro .
that policy should not be hold back .
give time restriction , i shall just make few brief comment .
i would like confirmation that information .
that be why it be wrong to call on all party to support negotiation under way .
party on which pressure need to be exert be turkey as occupy power .
turkey hold key to solution to cyprus problem and progress with its accession .
cypriot be not second class citizen some sort ottoman or or colony .
we be european citizen with european rights .
macedonium have fulfil condition and have be wait for negotiation to start since 200a mr swoboda say , many thing can not be resolve in way that we imagine they will be .
my third point concern cooperation with international war crime tribunal in hague .
therefore , common sense approach be need to these question .
it be hard to ignore ambivalence cyprus issue .
that be fact and we must resolve these double standard .
we know that ankara protocol must definitely be implement with regard to cyprus question .
its intention be that everyone , entire eu , should bring end to isolation .
turkey , too , have make significant progress .
if we look at ukraine , we can realize difference that very prospect accession can make .
turkey be welcome to membership on basis meet copenhagen criterion .
i think this could be see as condition for proceed with negotiation .
de madam president , i would like to comment on two aspect turkish issue .
it be generally ethnic conflict that be discuss , and rightly so .
there be still work to be do in this area and some difficulty remain .
this have happen recently in dispute involve tekel worker .
that be one comment that i would like to make .
eu also support these rights , in particular , in its role as social european union .
second factor be privatisation .
turkey be adapt to eu and this include area privatisation .
however , it be not only tekel employee who work in tobacco industry .
week ago , i have chance to go to ankara and speak with tekel employee .
therefore , we must put focus on social aspect eu .
i would like to emphasise that once again .
i know we should not talk about end new parliamentary term on first day .
we also wish this for country we be talk about today .
so much for positive result which spanish presidency announce that we could expect .
turkey be not part europe either geopolitically or in spiritual or cultural term .
human rights , rights minority and international law remain concept that be foreign to turkey .
el commissioner , we welcome you and wish you every success in you job .
today , we be debate , among or thing , turkey poss progress towards europe .
these two debate intersect at one point , they have one common ground .
course , part this be spend honor its obligation as member nato .
this have to stop and this must be strong message send to ankara by european parliament .
union poss institution refer to this country as fyrom .
these provision be legally binding in term international law .
therefore , there be no legal basis for greece to obstruct country poss accession process .
decision must be take on performance applicant country .
we need to talk about merit and closely monitor implementation reform .
base upon progress make , commission propose that country be give date to start negotiation .
course , talk be continue , but they have become bog down by turkey poss maximalist claim .
pez garrido give we this morning . ?
madam president , i have brief comment on turkey .
turkey still have some very serious problem in area human rights .
these minority be suffer from constant violation they rights .
cyprus and greece be , and will remain , utmost importance to european union .
some they be throw around unrealistic date .
we will strengn pro european force only if we adopt realistic approach and behave appropriately .
false promise be detrimental for both they and we .
let we be fair , let we be correct and let we be credible .
in turkey , we still have problem with obstacle face by religious community concern they legal status .
ecumenical patriarchate have limit rights to train clergy and freely elect ecumenical patriarch .
i be very grateful to rapporteur for emphasise all these aspect in report .
pez garrido poss speech . i regret that this matter be completely ignore in mr l ?
pez garrido , i have personal comment ideology and human rights do not mix .
madam president , i would like to speak on issue turkey .
unite kingdom be full .
we have million people unemployed .
pressure on we public service be incredible .
thought turkey join be not on at all .
we have be deny choice .
people in we country have be deny vote on lisbon .
we certainly need discussion in we country about wher we should be in european parliament or not .
i fear that turkey join will be straw that break camel poss back .
addition turkey join will just make matter far , far worse .
commissioner , it be you first day at work .
do we still consider value , share european value , important ?
these value be base on teaching christianity , irrespective proportion actively religious people .
do we deem cultural heritage europe important as cohesive force ?
if answer isye , turkey have no place in european union .
naturally , we should aim to establish best possible partnership with they .
i would have to state that israel do not have place in european community , either .
what can we do ?
there be to have be either breakthrough in accession negotiation or end talk .
today , talk be still in progress on further area relate to accession .
negotiation in themselves be positive thing .
unfortunately , it need more than minute .
i can assure you that greek be neither nationalist nor expansionist .
serious academic in skopje do not support nationalistic trend they prime minister .
i welcome progress record on internal reform , as be also indicate in 2009 progress report .
croatium will conclude accession negotiation this year .
in fact , report we be debate today be last progress report produce by european parliament .
we need instrument in this process .
i therefore welcome progress report for croatium and macedonium , which be valuable instrument .
i think that these instrument must be consider by european commission and government croatium and macedonium .
can i ask mr flautre question ?
can we ask mr f?le to carry out investigation into honor kill in turkey ?
fr madam president , question , yes , but which question ?
address to whom and for what purpose ?
i mention this just now in my speech .
that be why i mention earlier that accession meeting to be hold with croatium will begin immediately .
ba have emphasise . make with regard to croatium , as mr por ?
turn now to macedonium , debate center primarily on question its name .
candidate country , like member state , must therefore show utmost sensitivity in matter such as this .
we hope to open or negotiation chapter during spanish presidency .
we all agree , course , that turkey have to comply with additional protocol .
so i repeat , neighbourly relation be indispensable requirement for measure turkey poss progress in negotiation .
in any case , madam president , presidency poss position on negotiation with turkey be absolutely clear .
let i make two general observation .
first , i take promise i make during hearing very seriously .
in talk to candidate country and prospective candidate country , i always underline follow four principle .
first be strict commitment to copenhagen criterion they be non negotiable .
thirdly , process be honest and reflect credibility on both side and at all level .
fourthly , i will never underestimate issue integration capacity .
noneless , country continue to face many press challenge , include political criterion .
i know , however , that turkish government be still commit to democratic open .
neverless , i remain concerned about restriction on press freedom and media pluralism .
i be hopeful that we will be able to open more chapter this year .
however , turkey will need to make additional effort in order to be able to fulfil demand benchmark .
commission poss director general responsible for these issue will be in ankara next week for talk .
let i also add , have be request , follow position commission .
green line regulation be facilitate economic and personal contact between turkish cypriot and greek cypriot .
commission remain committed to accession process with turkey .
we leverage and influence in turkey will become all more credible and stronger if we commitment remain unambiguous .
i be look forward to very fruitful and close cooperation over next five year .
vote will take place during today poss vote .
certain passage resolution propose by committee on foreign affair be also quite strict .
it be commendable that new macedonian democracy have make further progress in all area society and business .
i very much welcome fact that presidential and local election in march 2009 go smoothly .
this be indication grow democratisation throughout entire region which be reflect in macedonium .
this represent major step forward .
however , macedonium still have number reform to implement .
there be two area where we should strengn we cooperation with regard to transformation and eu standard .
these be reform in public administration , in judiciary and in police .
croatium poss accession to nato in april 2009 have definitely strengn she claim for accession to eu .
stabilisation in what be know historically as balkan cauldron will be guarantee only by croatium poss accession .
i welcome progress make by croatium , in particular , in combate corruption .
measure must be take against corruption within institution .
not all country central and eastern europe come into european family at that time .
in 2007 , rumanium and bulgaria become member state european union .
however , accession these country can not be think as end european union enlargement .
at moment , country which be closest to accede to eu be croatium .
i appeal to both side negotiation for maximum flexibility and will to reach agreement .
this be why turkey must step up reform process in order to meet commitment it have assume .
let i give you few example on this point .
i would like to draw attention to notorious case violation rights woman .
unimaginable suffer die teenager be inflict as satisfaction forbringing dishonouron family .
this difference be serious obstacle in build common identity .
turkey poss involvement in guarantee eu poss energy security be just as important .
last year , i welcome turkey poss participation in nabucco project with signing intergovernmental agreement .
consequently , i urge turkey to make explicit commitment to implement nabucco project .
eligibility housing intervention in favor marginalise community

before vote on amendment 10
mr president , amendment 10 by green be not in conflict with amendment amendment 1 be about raise we ambition level to more than amendment 10 we amendment be about clarify condition to minus this be additional to , not in conflict with , amendment 1 , so amendment 10 should be vote .
this be new idea and we should vote on it .

so sometimes presidency be right .
be we here to vote as we be elect to do , or not ?
please put it to vote again so that people can make right decision .
we can not create precedent , voting can not be repeat .
in any case , there be difference 130 vote .

i do not think that it will be possible to overturn and change result vote .
2009 progress report on croatium
before vote on amendment 35
2009 progress report on former yugoslav republic macedonium
before vote on amendment 18
2009 progress report on turkey
before vote on amendment 13
it be pity that it take economic crisis to motivate this step .
mr president , greatest constraint on government be external competition .
good news be that electorate do not like it .
who could possibly disagree with cooperation ?
it do not avoid taxation .
what it try to do be avoid double taxation .
people from eu country still pay tax within they member state .
it be time to stop this imperialism .
top 10 be dominate by microstate liechtenstein , luxembourg , bruneus , jersey and so on .
if colleague doubt that , then i suggest they look around they .
to these sum can also be add more than eur 92 million already pledge by individual member state .
i want to stress this point .
european union have do its share and continue to do so .
it be main international donor .
we would have like she to be in haitus help or .
it be important that they be focus on long term recovery this terribly impoverished island .
we must also prevent risk child trafficking .
only rarely can earthquake such as this be predict .
they happen unexpectedly .
as old say go , we be as strong as we weakest link .
now solidarity european union be also be gauge .
how successful aid and cash effort be will be assess with reference to these criterion .
in this way , we can ensure that aid get to those who need it .
mr president , friday will mark one month since devastate earthquake in haitus .
death toll be now believe to be 230 000 , with 300 000 injure .
meanwhile , course , american be deliver real aid in most extraordinarily swift manner .
and what thanks do they get ?
they be accuse by french minister have occupy country .
if he do not , he be isolationist .
greece be on verge fiscal collapse .
we be about to mandate bail out in plain violation article 125 treaty .
one recent case , for example , be that 17 year old mosleh zamanus in december 200unfortunately it seem that prohibit execution child be not political priority in international arena .
i be also say this on special day for italian , because today be day remembrance .
we declaration today also show that commission , council and parliament be speak with one voice .
all this have be possible partly due to wait and see , over tolerant attitude west .
fus mr president , it be very obvious that situation in iran have reach crisis point .
it would seem that we in eu be incapable talk to iran .
this be so , we need to find new path .
in any case , we must be clear and defend european value even in we relation with iranian .
we should take note great culture and history this country .
current authority in iran be , perhaps , deny that great history and culture .
we should see future authority iran as partner .
we continue to receive information about further execution and more death sentence .
first reason be specific .
europe must take more decisive action to restrict this shameful procedure .
fus mr president , human trafficking be always act against humanity .
it be very important for we in europe ultimately to take tangible step to counter it .
that must not be so we need concrete action .
human trafficking be also still serious problem within european union .
we need to make every possible effort to fight human trafficking , which mainly affect child and woman .
we , as european , must always defend it , and in all circumstance .
it be very easy to refrain from act because or be do nothing .
we have take strong stance , however , and we have to proceed from that .
this make excuse be irresponsible and indefensible .
there be many thing we can do to maintain we strong stance .
this have not be do so far .
we can not resolve additional problem without additional resource .
we therefore need to make commitment , and we can not afford to wait any longer to do so .
we take firm stance at copenhagen .
that be why we be take on this responsibility here today .
mr president , i welcome opportunity to support this resolution .
copenhagen summit be disappointment in many respects .
we have to enhance and promote further activity aim at climate change treatment .
this mean that concentrate solely on co2 will not make world better place .
we have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with or state .
how can we negotiate more effectively with develop country and emerge economy ?
be it essential that these negotiation take place under aegis un ?
recently , there have be increase number report climate scientist have fake datum .
it be important for we to discuss this and make we opinion know .
i have experience great deal in my long career as politician .
for this reason , i have vote against this motion for resolution .
environment be altoger too important to be leave to left .
maybe we should consider why that be .
let we look at we own behavior here in this european parliament .
these scandal be lot more serious in term they consequence than this house would like to believe .
i have be concern about climate change throughout my 10year career as mep .
worst it be that eu do not follow what be happen in climate research right now .
we have come up with panic solution base on distorted information .
glacier be not melt everywhere .
in any event , contrary to what ipcc announce , they be not melt in himalaya .
water level be not about to rise and cover bangladesh , quite contrary .
gange delta be rise as result alluvial deposit .
white bear , which be say to be disappear , have never be as prolific as they be today .
it be probably astronomic in origin and not cause by allege greenhouse gas .
we already oppose this difficult topic during electoral campaign and include it in we manifesto .
how be we to explain this difference between two union ?
you only have to look at evidence in number member state to consider answer .
we have country that have run up big debt .
so , really , what should we be do ?
secondly , it suggest eu level levy on taxation area .
we have resist plan for this parliament to have europe wide tax .
although some consideration may be well intentioned , let we not forget that too much protection destroy all protection .
we group do not disagree with observation that woman must have control over they sexual and reproductive rights .
we do not agree with this .
it be therefore not we responsibility in eu to interfere in this issue .
pl mr president , i , too , vote against this report .
i do so despite be supporter gender equality .
in my country , abortion be not understand in this way .
i be persuade that how we view abortion be we own internal matter .
it be also dangerous that report violate subsidiarity principle , and do so on ill matter .
pl mr president , equality between woman and man be important subject .
unfortunately , i regret that i could not support this proposal .
firstly , these matter be among those which be exclusively for member state to decide .
i think human life deserve better .
let i explain myself better it talk about violence , about protection against violence .
equal rights , equal opportunity and equality between gender in everyday life be definitely in all we interest .
perhaps they have not read it .
nursery should only be last resort .
mr president , treaty rome contain one sentence on this subject .
it say , man and woman shall be give equal pay for equal work .
now , that sound pretty straightforward .
we all think we understand what that mean .
first , it definedequal paya mean equal pension rights and equal holiday and so on .
then it definedequal worka be work equivalent value .
how be employer suppose to judge that ?
be it question how hard it look like someone be work ?
do they have to factor in availability suitably qualify applicant ?
now we be talk about reproductive rights .
there be argument for all these thing .
it be outrageous for they to be impose on we by court .
court with mission be menace supreme court with mission be tyranny .
this type report damages we acceptance among population and among candidate country .
some ideological element relate to croatium and macedonium in progress report be also do we harm .
mr president , let i tell you story two african country .
result explosion elephant number .
we in this house do not think elephant in way that african do .
this , course , be what rhodesium now zimbabwe successfully do .
environmental policy should recognize basic aristotelian wisdom that that which nobody own , nobody will care for .
i be talk , course , about border dispute between slovenia and croatium .
this be not merely abstract concept it be one that affect people poss life .
that course constitute interference with competence slovene parliament .
and yet , this principle have not be enshrine in arbitration agreement .
i have therefore vote against motion for resolution because it do not reflect this principle .
c mr president , i , too , will be brief .
recent election have help in this .
they have show clearly that citizen this country want to share international standard and peaceful coexistence .
i also believe that democratic institution will manage to strengn negotiation with greece concern amicable solution to problem area .
c i will be very brief again .
despite this , majority mep support start accession talk some year ago .
turkey be not european country , but it be we most important partner on margin europe .
however , we do want close economic and political cooperation .
accord to progress report for 2009 , turkey still have long way to go .
i be among first supporter idea behind european commission poss proposal .
we in committee on economic and monetary affair have analyze and somewhat improve commission poss document .
in fact , member state should have option either to require transaction by transaction report or global transaction report .
it be with great conviction that i vote in favor mr casa poss report .
common and particularly serious form this fraud be know as carousel vat fraud .
total amount uncollected income be estimate at between eur 20 and 100 billion per annum .
criminal active in this area be particularly inventive .
miss trader then fail to remit vat to national exchequer .
it be crucial that we tackle this kind crime .
i welcome application reverse charge vat system .
however , i discern error in it .
meanwhile , subject do not pay vat , as he be not end seller .
only subject c sell final goods to consumer pay vat .
that be why i vote in favor this legislative resolution .
only reference which anyhow be already in commission poss proposal concern roma population .
when sign international treaty , european parliament expert will also be include in discussion .
these be people most in need , and they should not be exclude by reason they location .
this be global problem , and it affect thousand family all over europe !
this justify adoption special rule within erdf regulation .
live condition be crucial for every citizen poss self esteem and sense social worth .
these be reason that lead i to vote in favor follow amendment .
therefore it make no sense to limit regulation to only new eu 12 member state .
it have duty and means to ensure this .
eu can not allow itself to become socially underdeveloped region .
it will thus be possible to establish integrate and sustainable approach at eu level .
this report give eu concrete mean for help its citizen .
let we hope that it will be step towards social europe close to people .
i welcome second point this initiative to direct fund earmark for renovation to rural area .
this would make it easier for member state to legally implement cofinancing for rural home renovation .
they be unable to benefit from erdf support .
intervention in housing sector be possible during urban development operation and by renovate exist house .
objective proposal be to provide acceptable housing condition within framework integrate approach .
i believe that compromise agree today will be useful tool in combate fraud and evasion .
but when protection banking datum be at issue , good suddenly turn into evil .
this inconsistency can not even be justify in name efficiency .
automatic exchange all datum on every non resident in europe will lead to unmanageable flood datum .
precedent in field taxation savings should set alarm bell ring .
aim directive be to improve administrative cooperation in field taxation .
now more than ever , we need to help each or in this field .
mobility taxpayer , number cross border transaction and globalisation financial instrument have evolve considerably .
it be hard for member state to assess amount tax and duty correctly .
this be put smooth operation internal market at risk .
statistics show we that overall recovery rate be just 5 % .
in order to improve effectiveness claim recovery activity , closer cooperation be require at member state level .
with this in mind , i vote for proposal on mutual assistance in this area .
national provision relate to recovery only apply within territory each member state .
administrative authority be unable to recover tax and duty themselves outside they own member state .
that be why i vote in favor this resolution .
european union have all datum and instrument for get involve in long term reconstruction haitus .
i have pleasure and honor contribute to draft this resolution by parliament .
this prove that investment demand by parliament over year can have practical and positive impact .
on other hand , as after asian tsunami , we need to draw lesson from what happen .
haiti and its people need fire fighter , doctor , hospital and basic necessity .
unfortunately , too much time be waste on protection , and not everything have go smoothly .
we regret that resolution pass do not go far enough in defend haitus and its people .
we will continue to express we sincere solidarity with people haitus .
this make catastrophe even bigger than 2004 asian tsunami .
after emergency aid , we focus should gradually turn to long term development haitus .
finally , some colleague have question baroness ashton poss decision not to visit haitus immediately after earthquake .
they criticism be right if she visit would have result in something useful in help haitian .
mr president , i vote in favor resolution on haitus .
number those in need outside assistance be estimate at two to three million .
while sympathy european be with relative victim , there be need to act .
largescale and prompt commitment in form assistance from eu be obviously vital .
tardy reaction on part new foreign affair administration have provoke amazement , with good reason .
haitus will need help for long time .
its wound need tend and its home need build one by one .
you can not tot up pain .
there be no aggregate consciousness that would suffer more distress than single one .
distress mass be always distress single person .
i think that eu need to promote better coordination and higher profile in support haitian state .
i be pleased that eu have respond swiftly with eur 196 million so far in assistance .
we must act cautiously in this case .
tragedy have turn eye entire world on haitus .
therefore , i support call to cancel haitus poss international debt .
i vote in favor joint motion for resolution on recent earthquake in haitus .
in event natural disaster , humanitarian aid need to arrive without delay .
in haitus , only unite state be able to provide effective humanitarian aid without bureaucratic delay .
eu must not intervene in this situation as it will only exacerbate tense situation .
negotiation should be take in cooperation with or national government , not force upon from above by eu .
however , propose text do not do this in best way .
adopt text do not make any mention this .
this lead we to condemn policy pursue by iranian regime .
there be many country where democracy and human rights be in precarious position .
eu must continue its attempt to change this situation by means appeal and similar method .
we should not be surprise by action iran and its attempt to become nuclear power .
this be result , among or thing , misguided we policy .
i be in agreement with this .
i be glad eu be take very clear position on this matter .
there be definitely lack respect for human rights and democracy in iran in its current situation .
however , tighten sanction against iran be not right approach to take .
apart from this , eu be once again apply double standard .
for these reason , i have abstain .
ecr support strong resolution on iran .
we be in favor robust international action to deal with iran poss grow nuclear capability .
it should also be clarify that fortunately there be noeu embassiesin tehran .
there be national embassy .
islamic republic iran be unstinting in condemn poor treatment muslim throughout world .
conversion to christianity be consider as form apostasy and be punish by death penalty .
combate poverty and increase military aid will not make yeman poss problem disappear .
ultimately , eu must not allow itself to be force into role paymaster for we .
i ask to have reference to eas remove during draft stage , but or political group refuse .
ukip be totally oppose to people trafficking as it be modern day version slavery .
trafficking in human be be one most horrific and serious crime .
ten thousand young woman and child from new member state become victim human trafficking every year .
european parliament will have crucial role to play in combate trafficking in human be .
i vote for this resolution because european union must combat illegal immigration and human trafficking .
such situation can be exploit by criminal gang .
we must strive for closer cooperation among all interested party on question human trafficking .
this be unacceptable , and legal loophole must not be allow to facilitate it .
we need rapid , global , comprehensive and coordinate response , wher it be legislative or operational .
this be first step .
sadly , this terrible reality also take place within european union .
i therefore urge european commission to take strict and robust measure to combat trafficking in people .
you be irresponsible !
mr president , i endorse adoption resolution on human trafficking .
human trafficking be one worst wrong which people can inflict on or .
it be horrifying how common this terrible phenomenon be .
human trafficking be negation liberty , dignity and equality .
international estimate state that trafficking in people be third most lucrative illegal trade .
human trafficking be one greatest plague begin this century .
those who call it modern form slavery can not be accuse exaggeration .
it be activity which be exceptionally profitable , and be control by dangerous , organise criminal gang .
i hope this will provide new stimulus to intensify action against human trafficking .
we need to coordinate information better in order to combat this grow phenomenon more effectively .
human trafficking be most flagrant form human rights violation .
number victim this modern form slavery rise from year to year .
detection rate for this type crime be very low .
therefore , i endorse resolution european parliament on prevent trafficking in human be .
give incidental , individual item information about case human trafficking which have be uncover be not sufficient .
it take lawyer as long as three year to ratify it .
allow eu to set tougher sanction in this area ,
reference to treaty lisbon strengn eu action in criminal matter ,
and establishment superordinate legislative framework in this area .
it be i who launch campaigndo you know where you child be now ?
ukip believe that environmental protection be important .
next revise version budget must provide sufficient resource for measure that can meet this important challenge .
we can not lose sight we commitment to combate climate change .
as european , we must commit to target reduction in co2 more than 20 % by 20both europe and rest world invest much hope in copenhagen conference .
we can not be drive to mexico by vague and dishearten copenhagen agreement .
outcome 15th conference party cop 15 be disappointing .
we can not repeat same error that occur in copenhagen .
what we need be another economic and social model that oppose capitalism .
this resolution testify to fact thatbelieversin ipcc poss view have not understand anything .
these last two stipulation be miss from resolution , and i therefore vote against its adoption .
i vote against resolution because it contain too much wishful think .
last year , china become world poss lead exporter wind turbine equipment and photovoltaic cell .
copenhagen summit be very much miss opportunity in effort to tackle climate change . by 20in write .
this problem , which be matter concern all over world , need fast solution .
eu must be capable take lead role in fight against climate change .
sustainable future humanity be at issue here .
if nothing be do in time , we could reach point no return .
i therefore believe we need to propose new economic and social model to challenge capitalism .
copenhagen climate summit be rightly consider by most observer to be failure .
european union must begin effort to ensure that cop 16 conference in mexico will end with success .
in my opinion , we be still at stage when make binding and final decision be inadvisable .
there be simply no alternative to collective action on this issue .
this parliament must continue to support this approach .
it be important that lesson should be draw from failure in copenhagen .
i hope that mexico will have successful outcome .
i have vote against resolution .
unfortunately , number good amendment be reject .
people poss sense reality with regard to climate protection seem to have go out window .
this be not what i understand to be responsible policy for we citizen .
it can do so if it be able to provide itself with necessary resource .
copenhagen conference be failure .
reduction target must be measurable , significant and verifiable for everyone if there be to be climate justice .
there be need for continue detailed debate on various issue it raise .
ccctb be not about common tax rate .
taxation company be exclusive responsibility each member state .
we will not be use as moral alibi for such policy .
use ccctb to combat double taxation be like use sledgehammer to crack nut .
there be much more efficient way combate issue double taxation .
that be why i vote against recital study show this be most effective way to tackle tax evasion and protect revenue .
report refer to forthcoming impact assessment on propose common consolidated corporate tax base .
moreover , good tax governance be important pre condition for preserve integrity financial market .
such statement must , however , be follow by conclusion legally binding agreement .
and for this reason , i will vote in favor report .
deduction at source on all financial transaction would be far more effective method .
such deduction at source should be final tax .
it could become european resource .
so calledgood governancerecommend by european parliament lay bare every aspect citizensprivacy .
it be for these reason that i have not vote in favor these report .
vat , which this text also support , be one aberration this system .
we believe that measure at national level be more appropriate in this domain .
there be number amendment which directly or indirectly make reference to abortion .
malta be against abortion .
main political party be in complete agreement on this issue .
greater part society also concur with this view .
in addition , religious and moral aspect be important element .
these difference between man and woman have be particularly exacerbate by current economic , financial and social crisis .
every member state must ensure that worker both gender receive equal pay for work equal value .
victim human trafficking be mostly woman .
i welcome adoption this report on equality between man and woman in eu .
this report underline urgent need for community initiative to effectively combat violence against woman .
also , adoption this resolution integrate two dimension , which i consider to be fundamental .
firstly , recommendation for paternity leave at european level .
this resolution highlight commission poss responsibility to legislate in this area .
however , real major victory this vote be that it reaffirm right to abortion .
no european text have reaffirm this right since 2002 , due to reticence one right wing european party .
woman must have control over they sexual and reproductive rights .
it also promote much wider awareness sexual health matter for both woman and man .
however , this be not legislative proposal .
this be primarily statement principle which i be comfortable in support .
it be consistent with principle espouse by labor and social democratic party across europe .
this report do not and can not change that position .
equality between woman and man have long be fundamental principle european union .
however , despite progress make in this field , many inequality between remain .
four time more woman than man across europe work part time .
gender pay gap 17.4 % have barely narrow since 2000 .
global economic , financial and social crisis be cause woman to suffer adouble blow .
report marc tarabellum clearly emphasise greatest barrier to gender equality .
i know that some member do not take issue gender inequality and relate discrimination against woman seriously .
however , i be aware these complication .
fair division family and domestic responsibility woman and man will help to resolve situation .
relevant and serious issue like this deserve we attention , discussion and search for greatest common denominator .
i do not even think that this should be difficult to achieve .
once again , parliament have act as mere sound board for most extreme agenda .
let we hope that it will come to be implement in reality .
yes , woman encounter specific difficulty .
report also emphasise that woman must have access free charge to consultation on abortion .
we must stand up for principle subsidiarity .
many in my electorate in romania would be disappoint if i vote differently .
many woman die as result illegal abortion , perform without medical help .
i remain firm in my commitment to promote responsible sexual culture .
patriarchy still completely pervade we society .
there be still effort to be make in this area .
woman must be able to have full physical autonomy .
that be why i vote in favor measure relate to protection these rights .
this charter be legally binding and enable woman to be protect in same way as man .
woman should have control over they sexual and reproductive rights .
i believe that there have be effective legislation on protection woman since 197thi be area where principle subsidiarity should be apply .
these rights be essential part concept and self image modern european society .
i abstain from vote on recital x and paragraph 38 , which concern woman poss access to abortion .
in my opinion , current wording would infringe principle subsidiarity .
only then can eu achieve its goal growth , employment and social cohesion .
another positive feature be fact that much greater importance be give to commitment to family .
ecr have decide to vote in favor paragraph which support equality in this way .
ecr group have neverless vote against this resolution for two specific reason .
i vote against this resolution .
it divide rather than unite man and woman .
rapporteur also insist on woman have access free charge to consultation on abortion .
however , abortion come solely within competence member state .
as this resolution have no binding legal force , it can not be use to exert pressure to liberalise abortion .
thus , parliament be aim to destroy natural family as place socialisation and solidarity between generation .
this resolution do not offer any add value to woman or to man or to union .
i vote against resolution .
rapporteur , mr tarabellum , have not take account national context .
morality be part worldview incorporate into legal system country .
i see this conference as crucial to survival and sustainability many species .
reason be that this will affect livelihood maltese fisherman in very negative way .
i vote in favor cite convention report .
animal and plant species be become extinct at rate one thousand time faster than natural rate .
human activity be add to this rate extinction and be endanger biodiversity .
as such , i also support recommendation that environmental crime unit be strengn .
european parliament be call for total ban on marketing bluefin tuna internationally .
biological diversity be vital to wellbeing and survival humanity .
we must be ambitious and demand protection all species that be at risk extinction .
it aim to prevent excessive exploitation these species for international trade .
these must have support datum and substantiate scientific opinion .
that be indispensable .
species have suffer mark decline , be greatly overfish and be threaten by over exploitation for international trade .
it therefore meet criterion for listing in cite appendix i.
that proposal be not adopt .
inclusion corallium spp in appendix ius indeed seem over cautious and not properly corroborate by scientific datum .
bluefin tuna be threaten with extinction as result failure to control overfishing this resource .
ban on marketing it now seem inevitable .
it be aim at protect this species .
effort make by these fisherman can not fall on they shoulder alone .
we must be fair there be vast difference between industrial fishing and traditional fishing technique .
face with fisherman fiercely hostile to this ban , scientific and environmental expert be sound alarm .
as for spain and malta , they display silence be reprehensible .
urgency be there , however , and only radical measure can enable stock to be replenish .
small scale and sport fishing will still be permit .
such industrial and international fishing threaten traditional coastal fishing in mediterranean .
all member state be party to it .
unfortunately , eu be one main market for illegal trade in wild species .
within eu , national legislation vary from one member state to another .
union shall also stand up to or party to cite .
that be why i vote in favor this resolution .
i vote in favor adopt 2009 progress report on croatium .
after period deadlock last more than nine month , accession negotiation resume in october 200 report also note number issue affect process croatium poss integration into european union .
report adopt by european parliament plenary include amendment which i have table .
these amendment encourage croatium to continue its effort to promote cultural diversity .
nl have this parliament really not learn from its past mistake ?
despite this , accession these country be still vote through , and we all know consequence .
eu membership and associate massive stream funding have further embed corruption that be already present .
it be rocky road and be fraught with difficulty we portuguese know that only too well .
this hold true for croatium and any or potential candidate country .
i know that croatium can live up to its aspiration .
for we part , croatium can count on we complete support .
it be not croatium that i be oppose by vote against this progress report .
people croatium do not deserve to be ostracise in any way .
croatium be undoubtedly country among accession candidate which have make greatest progress until now .
implementation community acqui be , course , essential requirement in this respect .
report support croatium poss aim , which be why i have vote in favor it .
croatium have make extensive progress in many respects with regard both to its domestic and foreign policy .
we have adopt important resolution evaluate state accession negotiation with croatium .
very fact belong to unite europe be , certainly , not without significance .
i expect presidency and commission to take specific measure in this area .
this be very important for stabilisation in region .
there be no need to hurry and there be no time pressure that justify this process .
resolution on croatium be political resolution with no legal binding force .
i vote in favor it , because croatium should become member state in near future .
without balkan war , it would have join in 200us vote against this paragraph .
there be therefore no reason to suspect that croatium be nation hostile to lgbt minority .
despite all symbolic pressure , croatium retain full national competence in area link to non discrimination .
some these be material nature , while or be more historical or political .
i sincerely hope that it will .
i also believe that european union must provide assistance as part negotiation process .
sexual orientation be one non discrimination grounds in article 21 eu charter fundamental rights .
it be not fyrom that i be oppose by vote against this progress report .
people fyrom do not deserve to be ostracise in any way .
report give very good description next step to be take .
therefore , i be delighted with its achievement .
2009 be successful year for macedonium .
eu introduce visa free regime with this state .
this in particular foster development people to people contact .
last year , macedonium demarcate border with kosovo and improve relation with greece .
we also invite eu council minister to accept begin accession talk with macedonium in march .
progress make by macedonium in 2009 be also down to eu poss magnetic pull .
therefore , i vote for resolution , which praise these while also underline roadmap for further progress .
it be increasingly destructive freedom speech , write and even think .
i vote in favor adopt turkey poss progress report 200 european parliament feel that turkey be still not meet copenhagen political criterion .
far reach constitutional reform be require to ensure greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedom .
situation in turkey have improve in term freedom expression in minoritieslanguage .
yet turkey be friendly nation , with very rich history and culture .
it be we partner in nato and deserve to be treat as such .
i believe that eu must meet commitment that it have make to turkey .
for its part , turkey must commit further to reform process that be under way .
it be not turkey that i be oppose by vote against this progress report .
people turkey do not deserve to be ostracise in any way .
pt i have reservation about turkey poss eu membership .
there be or basic issue .
turkey have islamic identity that be very different from judaeo christian identity most eu country .
strategically speaking , it would be problematic for eu to have border with iraqus kurdistan .
secularity country be only hold in place by military force .
turkey have do great deal in its effort to comply with copenhagen criterion .
very significant progress have be make in term comply with standard market economy .
it be also territory which could provide route for transfer energy source to europe .
presence turkey in union could help stabilise this large and important region world .
turkey must understand that it can not change its past .
mistake have to be admit .
then it be easier to live and establish good relation with one poss neighbor .
in almost every area , progress have come to standstill or thing be move backwards .
double standard be be apply to religious freedom .
these be dreadful development .
turkey have show very clearly that it be still generation away from join eu .
in fact , reform be necessary and urgent , as resolution parliament ordain .
as you know , european parliament have be very active in this matter .
we parliament be compose member directly elect by citizen europe .
we main responsibility be for citizensright , and we must guard these rights .
we be fully aware this .
this be we first and greatest responsibility .
at same time , we realize how important swift agreement be for completely different reason .
therefore , find right middle ground , here , be important .
while this be happen , in recent month , treaty lisbon have come into force .
i have also write letter , say same thing , to mr barroso .
i have also be in touch with representative american government and with mr clinton .
this be important .
we must have full information , so that we can make decision on this matter in responsible way .
measure we have take will also be help by we discussion today .
that be why this discussion about swift be so important .
this can not be rectify ex post by mechanism oversight and control .
fact be that this house be always be promise jam tomorrow if only we would be patient .
however , we can not keep fall for fake promise jam tomorrow .
we need clear commitment now and ball be in council poss court .
i make that clear last week , but so far , it have fail to act accordingly .
why hide behind commission ?
council state yet again that it want to ensure that tftp will continue .
lack reciprocity be not be address .
council fail to clarify precise role public authority .
tell i i be all ear .
this be objective that treaty lisbon entrust largely to parliament .
that be context in which , together , we be fight terrorism all form terrorism .
i agree wholeheartedly with this statement .
mr president , it be widely acknowledge that international terrorism have bring new challenge to we society .
global approach be therefore need to eradicate it .
it lack rigid , hierarchical structure and so can only be combate with extraordinary intelligence effort .
prevention , coordination and intelligence be three word that sum up we strategy for tackle this huge threat .
european union have also increase its joint investigation body and team , information exchange and share analysis .
datum exchange without agreement have work uninterruptedly for many year .
these be just some example judge brugui?there cite in he report .
datum exchange have therefore deliver positive result .
it have allow we to investigate and prevent attack .
that have to be do in very short space time .
decision that be take be well know .
that be decision take .
it may not have be best decision .
we now know that commitment i have just set out be possible .
thank you , mr rubalcaba .
they be available in political group for you to see at any time .
in its reply , council have respond to we expectation , expectation parliament .
thank you , mr rubalcaba , for make this declaration and for explain council poss position on this .
it be very important to we .
european parliament have , course , show great interest in this matter .
report also highlight that tftp be valuable source reliable information necessary in fight against terrorism .
there be specific example and council refer to few they .
interim agreement be not only favor to we it be in we common interest .
that mean that datum hold on tftp database be effectively anonymous .
this be important .
agreement do not involve transfer virtually all swift datum to we treasury department .
i can assure you that only fraction swift datum will be transfer under interim agreement .
so refusal consent risk lead to both datum protection gap and security gap .
finally , interim agreement be only interim agreement .
it might not be best agreement in world .
it can and it will be improve .
european parliament will be fully inform at all stage this procedure .
i hope that this answer few you question .
m , for you explanation .
they be , truly , very important for we .
this be important .
we want it to be strong signal .
however , we know we be responsible to we citizen .
we be directly elect member european parliament .
we responsibility to defend citizensright be fundamental significance and we always stress this .
secondly , we strongly support security for we citizen and also citizensright and datum protection .
we response to text for negotiation be to make two very clear point .
firstly , we can not accept way in which this text have be produce .
it also become clear that it be only after this that thing start to move .
this have allegedly happen on some occasion .
council have send out encourage signal this week , but have not give any guarantee .
i would like to make that very clear .
however , gulliver believe that he have arrive in land giant .
that be mistake .
you have do so yourself .
how long will datum be store ?
who be store it ?
who be pass it on to whom ?
under term homeland security act , datum can be store for up to 90 year .
it be worth repeat that this datum can be store for up to 90 year !
all these factor represent serious fail in this agreement .
if you can do this , we will support new agreement .
objective new round negotiation must be to find compromise between these two thing .
this evening , i will suggest that my group vote against this agreement .
it be pleasure to see you here .
let we not forget that member state be not unanimous on this agreement either .
this be about european citizen be entitle to proper democratic and transparent procedure .
i do not consider that second brugui?there report be sufficient .
so , if council want consent this house , it will have to meet we demand .
that , council , be only way .
i be grateful to american for take part in this far reach dialogue .
nature task which lie ahead we have become clear to i .
council have not do this task justice in past .
we and europe have completely different definition terrorism and this be problem which pervade this agreement .
we must take action now .
we have tell citizen europe in course public discussion that we would do so .
we must vote against interim agreement and we must not postpone we vote .
parliament must not evade its responsibility again as it do in november .
parliamentary consultation and consent should not be retrospective tool .
we be now receive load assurance and promise from council and from commission .
however , i would like to focus specifically on content agreement .
we have big bror poss little sister wait for we approval .
personal datum will be store for decade and no one will have any control over how it be use .
in addition , datum can still be retain after agreement have come to end .
member state be allow or government to spy on we citizen indirectly via eu .
we find ourselves in situation in which parliament must stand up for its belief and make decision .
why should google be able to set datum threshold in future ?
in this context , i have hear many speech which refer to eu as community value .
mt let i make it clear that european popular party be in favor this agreement .
it be all for swift agreement and tomorrow will vote in favor .
this mean that new agreement will have to be draw up that will provide better guarantee regard security .
mr president , in you introduction you mention responsibility .
if possible , in order to retain more unity in this chamber , tomorrow poss vote should be postpone .
this be not sectarian issue for we but factual issue .
this be issue about wher badly draft agreement serve interest security and anti terrorism .
so we all agree that , for eu citizen , good agreement be what we want .
e mr president , i reject method and time use for this agreement .
which report should prevail , lady and gentleman ?
no , lady and gentleman , we have neither hold debate nor reach solution on this issue .
wording interim agreement guarantee rights .
i trust government unite state and great democracy by which it be establish .
finally , mr president , council and commission know what be expect they .
interinstitutional agreement be urgently need .
but you could not do even this today .
bulk transfer datum , commissioner say , be not problem .
only some datum will go there .
swift tell we that be not case .
there be no proof what you say in this statement .
you mention negotiate guideline that you be nearly do with .
where be they ?
i feel it be extremely important to fight together with unite state against terrorism .
these attempt to threaten we can be describe in one word ridiculous .
we and council be not try to rescue essential tool they be simply save face .
there be many agreement and measure in place to combat terrorism .
swift could be useful addition to these .
idea be to divert attention away from this fact .
interim agreement simply could not be worse .
it be full contradiction and inconsistency .
he have also note that negotiation this agreement be not conduct very well , or well enough .
therefore , we must find balance between security and privacy .
this balance must be reflect in agreement that we be currently debate .
. , i believe that we should aim for postponement and then ultimately .
colleague , this be very important discussion .
i do not want to disturb you but you be all talk half minute longer than you should .
there be 11 people on list .
if you all talk for such long time then i can not give floor to or .
de mr president , no one have any serious doubt about need to combat terrorism .
in this case , this question be easy to answer .
in particular , these measure must not be put in place with total disregard for exist democratic regulation .
therefore , i be in favor vote against this agreement tomorrow .
then anonymisation service be create on web , just as now in banking sector .
if terrorist can hide among ordinary people , security be reduce .
it be poor agreement .
instead i call for complete review all these anti terrorism law .
what do they cost and what be they collective effect on privacy and liberty ?
only then will i even consider vote in favor even more anti terrorism law .
show we how effective these measure be use open document , not secret one .
i would like to raise two matter .
i strongly emphasise wordall .
ro council send agreement to european parliament very late , which be extraordinary .
i hope that there will be no more recurrence incident this nature .
unexpectedly , they have listen to this institution , something which i hope will be repeat in future .
unite state have yet to introduce clear , transparent criterion for refuse visa in certain member state .
we should pick up on this and take opportunity to improve agreement .
we will therefore find ourselves in exactly same situation again during next plenary session .
i do not believe that this will change anything .
we have already be promise before this agreement that this time thing would be quite different .
once again , postponement will not help .
we have legal report that prove this and we have agreement on mutual legal assistance .
there have be many fail or bad investigation in european union .
in my constituency alone , 12 innocent people be detain and be not able to be charge .
what can we learn from those bad instance ?
we have time .
we back be not against wall .
there be way forward .
let we defer .
interim agreement that be negotiate lack datum protection .
datum protection be not luxury it be prerequisite we freedom .
there be lack reciprocity and lack proportionality .
we can not allow this .
we certainly hope that final agreement will be properly negotiate .
be it negotiate from poor basis or reasonable basis ?
sk say go that good agreement be make by equal partner .
i know that there be country in european union that have enormous problem with terrorism .
in my opinion , this consensus be extremely important , and we should not forget it .
i would like to make three comment regard issue itself .
this be just one example .
i would like to make two more point on this matter .
perpetrator these attack be all currently serve sentence in spanish prison .
we would certainly be little less secure it be as simple as that .
agreement under debate today be probably not perfect .
council be make commitment to do this .
therefore , we be debate interim agreement today which improve current situation .
council can not ignore this afternoon poss debate .
we can not ignore fact that this agreement have come in for great deal criticism .
i be ask on behalf council , that parliament give we this time for reflection .
concern , which , i repeat , echo council poss concern in many case .
mr president , this have be extremely important debate .
some they be answer in brugui?there report , so i would really encourage you to read that .
we do achieve certain concession from unite state and some very good datum protection mechanism .
this be important to recall .
now this be interim agreement , as i say it can and it will be improve .
we need to have more clarification concern redress , lawful datum processing and deletion datum .
mr lambrinidus ask why commission do not have that .
well , mr lambrinidi , commission have be in office for 16 hour and 20 minute .
this be extremely important negotiate mandate .
we have only very recently take office so you could not expect we to have do this .
we must take decision tomorrow .
give i more time to come back to you with better agreement .
have i understand what you say correctly ?
even more importantly , i have ask for time to consult with unite state .
de mr president , that be very helpful .
thank you very much for make this possible .
in or word , if we postpone matter and give ourselves more time , it will come into effect .
it be very hard for parliament to accept unconditional assurance .
mr rubalcaba , you have put you finger on it .
most argument put forward for debate in house have be fair one .
i have great respect for everything that have be say .
in she letter , mr henni plasschaert ask same question as manfr weber .
in my opinion , we be capable achieve this .
this be precisely what i be ask for .
i believe that in these circumstance , debate we be have today would be radically different .
mr president , lot have be say .
i think it be very unfair to use that as form argument .
it be very non committal .
it must be see , and i want it acknowledge , as departure from european law and practice .
i say this before and i want to hear it again clearly .
netherland and belgium can not end up be dupeof all this .
vote will take place on thursday , 10 february 20written statement rule 149
cooperation with unite state to combat terrorism be important , but not at any price .
however , we can not accept this agreement .
we very much hope they will seize this opportunity .
threat terrorism be not get smaller .
for behind all terrorist be organization which train they , supply they with explosive and finance they .
terrorism have to be well organise to survive , and for this it principally need money .
we should make every effort to ensure that final agreement guarantee necessary protection personal datum .
when we be talk about security , political game should be set aside .
body scanner operation intelligence service in context counter terrorism strategy debate
we be talk about mistake make in attack that fortunately do not happen .
there be five conclusion .
secondly , detroit highlight importance collect datum , but also integrate and analyze it .
in my opinion , personality suspect terrorist be very significant factor in relation to this issue .
this bring we to debate on information management .
we have framework eu within which we can exchange information appropriately .
these matter be debate in formal and informal council transport minister .
these study will be available to council and this house in near future .
these consideration must be take into account in we next debate .
my priority as transport commissioner be definitely safety and security passenger .
this be major priority for we common transport policy and this be always extremely important .
incident show first all failure intelligence , failureto connect dot .
aviation remain target for terrorist .
we can not ignore this fact .
aviation security must therefore be guarantee by all appropriate means , in full compliance with fundamental rights .
some think that they be considerably better .
i intend to present to you in april report on imaging technology and its use at eu airport .
this report will address question raise in european parliament resolution 200we need to look at these question seriously .
to my mind , eu framework would be better .
eu framework guarantee uniform standard in relation both to security and to respect for individual rights .
as minister just say , terrorist develop .
we must develop as well , and body scanner be only one element in this variety .
i look forward to you view and 
mr president , this be commission poss new dual approach .
this will be basis upon which i will decide how to move forward .
i look forward to bring this evaluation to you and to discuss it with you .
denver flight show that recently .
this , course , be commitment that it still valid .
there can be no freedom without security and there can be no security without freedom .
we have to react to non conventional threat and to improve detection threat .
i will do so this year .
we also have cbrn action plan propose by commission last june and agree by council .
this action plan consist 130 measure .
we will also have to revise how we use we financial resource .
this might be by create internal security fund , which be foresee in stockholm program .
we have to avoid we policy be perceive as ambiguous or as apply double standard .
you give we very hopeful prospect .
look back , we have to say that terrorism be real threat to people europe .
we be take positive action and i would like to extend my sincere thanks to public authority .
people who be responsible for security have do good job over recent year .
i would also like to thank we partner .
now we must look to future .
what will we be face with over next few year ?
in this respect , i have three specific request or proposal .
first concern cooperation among authority in europe .
every document come with headline emphasise importance collaborate and strengn we cooperation .
these be wonderful word , but nothing have happen in practice .
once again nothing happen in toledo with regard to practical cooperation .
there be no lack action this have be make clear in detroit .
what we be lack be cooperation between authority .
after interval few year , it be important to put it to test .
thirdly , we have just have discussion about swift .
therefore , question arise as to wher we be self confident enough to evaluate it ourselves .
first all , we must take coordinate , harmonise european approach .
we need more security in this area .
event in detroit and munich have show that there be security loophole .
they be already in place in we , in nerland and in or country .
however , this raise issue wher body scanner will really make air travel safer .
this be one crucial question that we must ask ourselves .
there be , in fact , whole series question relate to body scanner .
what type technology be be use ?
what type radiation do they emit ?
can they cause damage to health ?
what do they allow people to see ?
just few green or red dot or whole person who be be scan ?
finally , can we ensure that datum be be protect ?
also , these scanner be expensive .
if we be go to install they , who will be pay ?
there be lot question to be answer and we be in process do this .
you also want to do this and present we with solution .
whatever happen , we need solution which cover whole europe .
we also need to take into consideration tel aviv and possibility use another method .
we need to search for bomber and not bomb .
these specification cover privacy , datum protection , human dignity , health and freedom choice .
at heathrow airport in london , this equipment be be use without element freedom choice .
latest generation scanner satisfy requirement that parliament have lay down .
if such spot be see , passenger in question be check separately on spot .
latest scanner also do not have any effect on health .
radiation they give off be less than that from mobile phone .
what be more , scanner be also user friendly .
that will therefore also make difference to cost for air traveller .
however , mr president , latest scanner be additional security tool .
this email speak post detroit era .
no surprise there .
each machine cost eur 250 000 .
it do not , unless it refer to era sheer effrontery .
european citizen also need to know that we in parliament have responsibility .
yes , we do indeed need to investigate terrorism .
i be sorry to say that these be incorrect .
idea that terrorist threat have not diminish be debatable and should be debate here .
now we find ourselves debate database and police practice future .
be this where we want to end up ?
can there be any greater mockery human rights ?
we be face up to this challenge on both technical and parliamentary level .
i would like to say one thing first all .
however , we can develop natural technique that will allow we to come close to complete security asymptotically .
we need to take some fundamental rule into account , both outside and inside parliament .
course , it be obvious that personal rights must be protect .
there be number factor to be take into account in this area .
mr president , you say that there be three commissioner who be responsible here .
we be very happy about this .
may i quote only one who be not here .
that be exactly kind statement we should be make at this early stage .
this be serious fight .
i have be stop many time at airport .
mr president , i want to talk about respect for rule law by intelligence service .
ruling today by uk court appeal have blast open british government poss attempt at secrecy .
in 2006 , i lead mep delegation from we temporary committee on extraordinary rendition and torture to london .
he owe i and , more importantly , british and european public , apology .
mr president , back to body scanner .
i remain view that any measure which increase security for travel public must be welcome .
i fundamentally object to that policy .
some expert have already say that explosive use would not have be detect by such scanner .
so much for body scanner .
eight year later , in 2008 , figure have reach 16 000 people .
in comparison , 6 000 people die aid every day .
what do these figure tell we ?
secondly , war on terror have fail .
it have only succeed in increase problem .
we must push forward with development this interface and it must be finance by commission .
we should anticipate event , but we do not .
take decision on body scanner in airport be responsibility that we can not avoid , lady and gentleman .
we can not wait any longer because terrorist be not wait .
once this be guarantee , we must adopt decision for european union as whole .
however , there be also three institutional element .
first be cosus , standing committee on internal security .
fr mr president , one means prevent terrorism be information .
be this really case today ?
nothing be less certain .
do we intelligence service keep they european counterpart up to date ?
parliamentary supervisory body on matter be urgently require .
this entail creation parliamentary supervisory committee within european parliament .
i wonder , and i ask parliament do we want debate on terrorism ?
it seem that no one be willing to deal with subject .
we talk here about cooperation security force .
we need to support we security force with equipment they need to prevent terrorism .
believe i , terrorism destroy life and shatter community .
what utter nonsense !
i hope that three they will be resolve by study that commission be carry out .
i ask that they conclude they promptly and refer they to parliament .
firstly , be it necessary and effective ?
secondly , be it or be it not harmful to health ?
thirdly , do it or do it not violate privacy and dignity individual ?
there be , however , or concern .
initially we be tell that it would be optional .
i have two question concern body scanner .
in term security , do these scanner make it possible today to really guarantee security condition ?
mr president , terrorism be define as use violence and intimidation to achieve political end .
those we who value peace , freedom and democracy ought to be concern about terrorism because it work .
sinn f?in ira now hold post in government norrn ireland .
they bomb , shot and murder they way to success at ballot box .
what better example successful terrorism be there than those communism in russia , eastern europe and asia ?
china be still terrorise by chinese communist party after 61 year power .
no greater example successful terrorism exist than that .
and , course , president european commission , mr barroso , be former maoist .
no doubt future terrorist will find this all extremely encourage .
some government have legitimately start to test body scanner on more sensitive route .
course we must defend personal rights , but without prey on people poss fear .
lady and gentleman , we now come to catch eye .
these be name i will call out .
i will simply stop microphone after one minute .
i will not bang my gavel , i will not beg and i do not want to be misunderstand .
i shall call speaker in order that i have
mr zasada
mr iacolino
mr matulum
mr leichtfry
mr enciu
ms flasikova benova
mr tannock
m ernst
m rivasi
and mr molzer .
one minute each , and that be it .
apology to rest you .
use this type equipment still leave series unanswered question .
what effect do scanner have on health passenger who be scan ?
how will protection image people who be scan be guarantee ?
it be no longer possible for individual member state to do what they want .
this apply in particular to body scanner .
public be less aware effect terahertz radiation .
sk terrorism have no value , nor do it have any deeper meaning .
only aim terrorism be death .
death civilian at lowest possible cost .
this be perhaps story various suicide attacker .
instead , i argue we should bring on israeli style profile passenger .
we need to ask ourselves two question .
we do not currently have any clear answer to this question .
i would like to see this assessment complete before we do anything else .
second question concern risk to health .
this be long term measure and i would like to know to what extent it will harm my health .
no real assessment have be carry out in this area .
therefore , i be call for clear answer and not for hasty reaction .
indeed , we should be aware that frequent exposure to low dose radiation can cause cancer and malformation .
my question therefore concern justification risk .
despite this , usefulness various anti terrorism measure have never be call into question .
instead , every attack be follow by further restriction on civil rights and liberty .
mr president , i have listen carefully to speech by all group and member on this topic .
we have hear some extremely interesting view , and i welcome they .
if we adopt measure that will undermine we principle , we be probably make serious mistake .
europe have strategy for its counter terrorism policy .
we have important figure , counter terrorism coordinator , whose speech be very interesting .
that be why we be focus we common effort , as i say , on prevention .
we be also keen to ensure correct exchange information .
this have be emphasise in house on various occasion .
that be information that need to be transmit .
there have be significant improvement recently in european union in that regard .
ideally , we will be able to decide on common solution at european level .
however , there be little doubt that common position on this matter would be extraordinarily helpful .
i believe these be three topic that we need to examine .
once report be available , we will adopt common position , which i believe be necessary .
mr president , i ask direct question to council and i would like answer .
this be not case .
terrorism develop and we , too , must use all technological development to defend we citizen and passenger .
so do not demonise new technology .
we will come with report and then we will continue this discussion .
counter terrorism be important tool for fight terrorism .
i agree with certain member who have say that .
there be certainly measure for do that .
this be totally natural .
we will do this .
we will also have to give full consideration to respect for fundamental rights .
so this be how this commission will work .
thank you very much for important and very engage debate .
terrorism remain high level threat in european union .
use body scanner be delicate issue .
i think that there be important factor which must be examine carefully before make decision on this .
european commission be due to produce three study on use and effect body scanner .
i have always take stand that it be question priority .
it be question wher passenger be prepare to sacrifice they discomfort for they safety .
civil liberty group have duty to weigh all new measure be advocate .
those propose new measure such as body scanner have duty to prove they necessity .
it be apparent that current procedure , in particular , body search , be not sufficient .
it have be establish that body scanner be more effective .
problem be that they may offend passengersdignity .
therefore , this be issue which have to be address .
many possibility exist .
for instance , different body scanner for different gender man by personnel same gender .
therefore , once we have evaluate exist situation , we must continue we work in this sensitive area .
they have condemn deportation as intolerable violation press freedom .
we must find way protect we citizen and prevent they from become victim terrorist act .
body scanner may be one way strengn security in airport and on board aeroplane .
i await with great interest study that european commission will submit on this matter in march .
this be why these issue should be investigate in they overall context .
safety be key issue in we life it be most important issue .
only use device compliant with this set requirement be acceptable to we .
we can not wait for another catastrophe before act to protect air passenger .
we need pan european approach to issue scanner airport security need to be uniform .
i eagerly await conclusion commission report impact body scanner .
it seem to i that this be not , however , correct understanding matter .
if we give up part we liberty in favor security , will we security really be guarantee ?
information we be receive about this make we very sceptical .
history teach we that in crisis situation , special service want to take simplest route .
terrorist threat have make we agree more readily to restriction we own freedom .
this system have prove its effectiveness over many year .
i totally agree with find viable solution for enhance we citizenssecurity .
and when you dare to protest , they laugh in you face .
you would agree this be abuse .
to fight terrorism effectively , we need coordinate action , include eu rule on scanner .
decision on compulsory use scan equipment must be make .
there be no point talk about it at all if scan be to be voluntary .
for it be difficult to suppose that terrorist will agree to be scan .
very important question be , course , safety scanner for health .
research should be coordinate by european commission with full cooperation member state .
scanner use must have safety certificate allow they use in all member state .
mr president , new method search passenger have be introduce at some european airport .
alongside current form security , full body scanner have be bring into use .
there be no clear regulation on storage and protection datum collect by scan .
situation in ukraine debate
as you will be aware , second round presidential election take place on sunday in ukraine .
it be important because democratic ukraine will serve as important example to its neighbor .
statement issue by high representative on monday express this sentiment .
it also congratulate people ukraine for they continue commitment to democratic process .
it be clear that ukraine poss democracy be continue its process consolidation .
this be significant achievement .
most importantly , it demonstrate ukraine poss attachment to european value .
election have winner and loser .
preliminary election result show very small gap between two contestant .
we have already hear about possible challenge to result in court .
some local court case have already be initiate .
it be logical and legitimate that any possible problem be investigate .
every election be demonstration popular will .
it be also opportunity for new start .
it be now vital for ukraine to move forward .
ukraine have consistently hold good election , and have vibrant civil society and free media .
regrettably , however , overall reform process which be vital for ukraine have significantly slow .
much more should have be do in past year .
weakness ukraine poss constitutional framework have also contribute to this .
this be also precondition for disbursement possible eu macrofinancial assistance .
eu poss message to ukraine poss leadership be consistent and clear now be time to act .
we expect to see concrete step forward .
it be in ukraine poss own interest not just to please international community .
this message be also already convey at eu ukraine summit 4 december 200action be need at many level .
we have many tool to do so .
through european neighborhood policy , we have means to support ukraine poss own reform effort .
eastern partnership have bring additional tool .
but we offer to ukraine be not one way street .
we look forward to work with ukraine poss new leadership to achieve we common goal .
madam president , commissioner , we be rather disappoint .
he be certainly responsible for failure orange revolution .
i hope that these election will bring new stability to ukraine .
instead , it cause we to watch ukraine with great concern .
mr f?le , you have specific responsibility relate to neighborhood policy .
however , neighborhood policy do not simply mean go on as before .
we must give they perspective .
now to matter in hand .
one rule democracy be that you accept result election as it be .
recent presidential election can be see as another step in consolidation democracy .
there be say that revolution devour its own child .
this be true , but ukraine remain state even after these election .
it still have its multus party system , and this be mainly thanks to orange revolution .
and all this be very important .
it be crucial precondition for bilateral and multilateral cooperation that ukraine poss government continue to implement its objective .
we have to continue talk on association agreement between ukraine and european union .
in recent time , tempo have be slow , and we must speed it up again .
we also have to put more concrete content into energy and environmental cooperation .
we hope that ukraine turn round these shortcoming .
madam president , first all , i would like to pick up on what mr brok say .
none citizen whom i meet have great expectation this election .
internal fail in ukraine be mirror by fail in european strategy .
we must not take this lightly any longer .
gas be one subject which always cause great deal consternation .
i only need to mention sevastopol , where we be face major conflict .
we can not simply let thing go on as they have before .
you have take on significant responsibility in this area .
she can stand up for she suppose rights .
close election result reflect fact that country be split into two camp .
give close result , both camp will have to make compromise .
i share mr harmsregret , here , that mr ashton be not with we today .
in this sense , mr brok be not right when he say orange revolution lose .
it win , because it be all about have rule from which everyone could benefit .
however , this be good this be how it should be .
have we answer that question ?
can far reach reform be carry out in post communist country without that promise ?
can we encourage people to make sacrifice if we tell they they will always be keep wait outside ?
to say that be great opportunity for new commissioner , mr f?le .
mr ashton have not come , today .
commissioner , be bold and be first person who start to say that there be room .
this will be great help to ukrainian .
this must not just be say to elite , to businesspeople or to student .
it be opportunity for you , too , mr f?le .
say this clearly , and you will go down in history .
everyone must feel that they have opportunity .
we need to say very clearly door to europe be open for ukraine .
someone must , at last , after these five year , say it .
madam president , ukraine poss recent election have show that country be function democracy .
new president will be govern in face robust opposition and free media .
european union must respond with clear signal welcome both trend .
at same time , ukraine need to speed up its reform .
if such progress be make , eu must consider extend promise membership to ukraine .
in meantime , we should encourage and do much more for integration at grassroot level .
we must ensure greatest possible flow people across we frontier with ukraine .
after election in ukraine , something will change .
new openness to ukraine be need from european union .
let we not be motivate by personal ambition .
however , let we not push new president ukraine into arm moscow .
ukraine be go to be partner from whom much will be expect .
ukraine be go to be partner who should be treat with goodwill .
eastern partnership and euronest initiative offer suitable framework for this .
question be wher ukraine can consolidate democracy internally .
this mean establish democratic norm and protect human rights .
this be not solely fault they political elite .
it be true that they be too consume with conflict power and influence .
many reform be never implement , and many never leave draw board .
it suggest that there be unworthy and undesirable intention behind it .
what would we expect from eu ?
solidarity .
commissioner , you say that we expect energetic and purposeful action from ukraine poss new president and new administration .
however , we should say something to european union .
european union must give ukraine alternative european vision .
perhaps these presidential election will help bring country out political stalemate and will provide more stability .
ukraine be still decide which model civilisation it should subscribe to .
should country cooperate with east or choose integration in europe ?
people ukraine have express they will to choose leader they country .
ukraine be european country which must have right to take decision on europe .
sl commissioner , you report on ukraine today be very clear .
basically , close contest have expose how complicate this country be .
attach label to this country or spread any kind prejudice about it would be negative thing .
he will content himself , instead , with fta and visa liberalisation regime .
it probably will not happen but , if it do , it must be peaceful and by consensus .
it be encourage that this be result fair election .
otherwise , result next election will already have be decide .
eu must provide close support and assistance for this stabilisation process .
again , i apologise to all those to whom i could not give opportunity to speak .
i be sure it be subject to which we will return again .
as i say at begin , ukraine matter .
it remain partner strategic importance for european union , and leader in region .
eu ukraine relation have deepen considerably in past year .
i firmly believe that this dynamic should continue in future .
that will encourage i to be even braver .
vote will take place during second part session in february .
more than half million ethnic romanian live in this country .
authority in kiev have hirto show they little interest in term guarantee basic rights .
ukraine be currently face with two value system .
another group citizen look at european integration with distrust .
after presidential election , new chapter begin in relation between eu and ukraine .
one most important area cooperation will be issue energy supply .
furthermore , effort aim at expand storage capacity be also worth support .
european parliament be expect to adopt new gas supply regulation for eu in spring .
this regulation will require member state to approve coordinate action plan in event gas supply disruption .
ukraine continue to be crucial for stability and democratic development europe .
but we can not look away from responsibility european union policy toward ukraine since 200 eu have not be eager to offer ukraine prospect eu membership .
this will remain eu poss responsibility .
now we need to make maximum use eastern partnership .
europe should consider make specific proposal to include ukraine in european structure .
i hope that new president will take into account pro european direction express by majority ukrainian .
election promise must be fulfil .
ukraine be european state and share all europe poss cultural value .
for example , there be romanian speaking minority in ukraine number more than 410 000 .
i be pleased that ukrainian election last sunday pass off well .
it be also in we interest that relation between ukraine and russia be consolidated .
question time council
next item be question time b7 0006 2010 .
subject create internal energy market
in create internal energy market , community have undertake to speak with one voice .
madam president , internal energy market and security energy supply be inextricably link .
lt minister , once again , i would like to thank you for you thought and answer .
member state concerned should also act as one on this matter .
internal energy market need better interconnection between national power network .
baltic state have be hit very hard by economic crisis .
i be think in particular price volatility .
subject development approach , objective and action under eu poss 2020 sustainable development strategy
ro we also now have comment which have come from stakeholder .
public consultation about eu 2020 strategy on commission website be over .
you mention case spain which indeed have suffer greatly in property sector .
subject freedom religion in china
i can assure you , mr posselt , that religious freedom form integral part those criterion .
de mr garrido , thank you very much for you detailed answer .
i have two brief additional question .
firstly , when will you next have opportunity to discuss these matter with china ?
council have investigate these case and have bring they to attention chinese authority .
lot do lot more to do .
it be very carefully phrase .
religious beliefi guarantee , but what about practice ?
what constitutesnormal religious activity ?
lot do , but awful lot more to do so keep up good work .
de thank you for you accurate answer , mr garrido .
subject cium secret prison and flight
number or trial be under way , notably in poland and uk .
what measure will it propose to ensure that these circumstance be not repeat in future ?
this continue to be we opinion .
pt madam president , minister , thank you for you response .
in fact , however , even after that statement in july , there be new discovery .
obama administration merely declare that it be disappoint with decision by italian court .
we will continue to act and develop along these line .
namo . ago , special parliamentary commission be appoint on guant ?
european council also work on this matter , and now keep come back to it .
i agree with point make by last speaker .
in this respect , i believe that role press be absolutely vital one .
question time be close .
sit be suspend at 19.25 and resume at 21.00			 
effect economic crisis on world trade debate
effect crisis on world trade indicate possible 10 % decline in 200thi represent biggest such contraction since second world war bring on by collapse in global demand .
keep international trade flow be vital for eu and or export orient country .
in this case , eu industry need to retarget its export market and possibly future its product .
what strategy do commission intend to pursue to enable eu industry to become more competitive ?
these trade deficit have contribute to global imbalance that be at root global economic crisis .
what strategy do commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalance in its trade policy ?
for example , we be see sign economic recovery now , but level unemployment remain very high .
i suggest focus in my initial reply on contribution trade policy to economic recovery .
by and large , only few country resort to trade protectionism .
in order to maintain this , it be important to remain extremely vigilant .
external source growth will be crucial to eu economic recovery .
i therefore concur with you that european industry should target new and fast grow emerge market .
this will be priority for i as trade commissioner .
this strategy will have effective external dimension in which trade policy play key role .
but trade policy be about more than just competitiveness and growth .
it be also about project we value worldwide and it must also duly integrate development dimension trade .
promote strong contribution to development goal be already important part eu poss trade policy .
current multilateral negotiation be development round .
we have bilateral and regional negotiation with develop country and autonomous preference in favor these country .
madam president , i , too , would like to start by welcome commissioner .
it be pleasure to see you here .
you have important task ahead you .
year ago , i be extremely concern .
however , no trade war come about .
i think it be important to stop and reflect on why that be .
i would say that it be too early to declare crisis over .
that be not necessarily protectionism , but at time , they be only hair poss breadth away .
it be , in any event , expression mercantilism that i believe to be damage .
that would amount to consider action and leadership on we part .
we in parliament need to reflect on that too .
i would like to return to these idea .
property and tourism be sector which have be particularly affect by this .
this have extremely powerful effect on employment .
however , number issue remain on agenda , some which have already be mention .
what commercial policy instrument do european union have available to tackle financial crisis and its repercussion ?
i be count exclusively on this europe 2020 strategy to find these answer .
madam president , commissioner , thank you for have put fantasy crisis relate protectionism into its proper context .
now , i almost want to reverse issue .
in same way , we keep be tell that liberalise trade with china be good for we .
until we define these choice , we shall be pursue strategy failure .
this , course , be intend to produce better standard live .
problem begin when economy slow down , market index fall sharply and problem start with unemployment .
this be or side coin .
this can be see clearly in current situation .
i think present crisis will be test for all we .
i be think principally , here , about country belong to european union .
we must also use we strength advance technology and human capital .
this crisis world capitalism be enormously exacerbate by activity financial speculator on world market .
but what do commission do ?
that , concretely , be prescription commission .
therefore , ten thousand greek worker who march yesterday be absolutely right .
we need to replace it with system human solidarity , base on value democratic socialism .
last year , uk economy contract 4.8 % .
so do italy poss .
german economy contract 5 % and eu trade much more so .
now , one prerequisite for competitive and dynamic knowledge base economy be to have flexible work force .
so what have eu do to bring this about ?
and , incidentally , it be by have flexible workforce that you raise people out poverty .
eu economic crisis reveal that eu have , as it be , no bathing costume .
hu i would like to talk about two issue trade deficit and co2 emission .
this be three fold increase in 4 year .
this mean that consumption each european citizen exceed produce value by eur 500 .
such large trade deficit and consumption that exceed production to such extent be not sustainable .
however , this would incur much higher social cost .
current event in greece illustrate this .
if we do not reduce energy consumption , there be danger that again and again .
if you believe commission , trade drop by 10 % in 200if you believe imf , it drop by 12.3 % in 200 sv madam president , we continent be rich one .
eu must shoulder particular responsibility for maintain free and fair trade .
develop country be particularly vulnerable when they export fall and they have problem obtain bank financing .
for acp country , for example , trade in goods represent 50 % they trade .
these country be thus extremely sensitive to crisis .
1 % drop in growth result in 20 million people fall into poverty .
it be unreasonable for rich eu to force out poor farm in africa through competition .
eu can and must act as beacon for liberalisation world trade .
globalisation and international trade be fundamentally positive .
protectionism be evil and have always be evil .
many farm stop grow sugar beet , we increase unemployment and do not achieve any social or economic benefit .
i think that during crisis , we should give strong protection to we economy and we producer .
we should act in similar way on many or matter .
euro poss stability be paramount importance to trust we trade partner .
and it be these country , develop country , which need open market that can receive they product .
at same time , we must not overlook dynamic increase in export by certain emerge economy .
however , protectionism further hurt international trade and eu poss interest directly .
another instance which may be recall be temporary tariff on drug that russia have impose on eu exporter .
as consequence , total 30 % eu poss product line have see increase tariff .
in my country , there be say that attack be best form defense .
should we not make more proactive use we global europe strategy and forcefully implement point it contain ?
be it not now right time to address we interest proactively instead simply prevent protectionism ?
i think we should take logical step negotiate free trade agreement quickly .
however , what have happen with regard to india , canada , colombium and peru ?
many or member have refer to develop country .
i look forward to hear you answer , mr de gucht .
at same time , as we relative size decrease , we negotiate power decrease as well .
time be work against we , even more than before as result crisis .
how do we rate importance these relation ?
european union must first all find happy medium between ultra free trade and protectionism .
to my mind , this third way must be embody by creation fair trade framework .
how can this be achieve ?
i would like to propose look at difference between these two guide principle in three area .
be it good for environment that goods be deliver from great distance ?
ro i would like to congratulate commissioner on he new appointment .
new theory come into be they be too big to fail .
no banker should be get more than prime minister he country , and we should work towards .
advantage free trade in global economy ought not to need explain to anyone .
we be pleased to see such astute and successful politician and well know liberal on commission .
we must fight against any protectionist tendency .
we be also face new world order .
therefore , i call on commission to develop new strategy for world trade .
mr de gucht , fortunately you be also responsible for transatlantic economic council tec .
i would be very grateful if you could devote you attention to tec .
i have only two or three minute if i understand rightly .
have say this , let i start with general remark .
i really do not believe that protectionism be solution .
idea that we could export without import be completely false and contradictory to fact .
that bring i to origin crisis we be go through .
hopefully , major part be behind we .
i think that be only good response .
also , within asia , or asian country be face very fierce competition from china .
so what we should do be become stronger ourselves .
we should work on that , but , have say this , it be not easy at all .
first all , i must say that i like name robin hood much better than tobin .
be member state european union also imply some obligation .
at same time , these country have also be hit hard by credit crunch .
this be point at which we must start .
secondly , we need regulation for company that have suffer damage as result crisis .
some country have resort to protectionist practice , while or be try to liberalise trade .
do european commission , when take anti crisis measure , take these into account ?
eu south korea free trade agreement debate
that be very good thing .
all these sector and many or hope to gain major benefit from agreement .
however , main protest be come from car industry .
these term be reciprocity , european interest , fight against dump and fight against tariff barrier .
how can we also fail to take into account serious doubt over textile and electronics industry ?
we all welcome birth new europe in lisbon with hope .
europe can not however , fail to take responsibility for european interest in world , particularly today .
agreement with korea actually legitimise pass through financing with china which , until now , be illegal .
free and fair trade form basis for europe poss prosperity .
we must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendency .
this may lead to one side cost benefit for south korean industry .
however , we urgently need to clarify this in interest company involve .
system must be applicable in practice .
for this reason , provisional version agreement must not be allow to come into force .
i know from discussion with company what important impact implementation have .
in we opinion , at least , this should be include .
thank you , commissioner , for you point view on previous debate .
simplification certification procedure , transparency and price predictability be all thing that will benefit consumer .
inclusion duty drawback clause have be concern for many we , as i mention .
commission have assure we that korea be actively liberalise its import regime .
level duty that korea can refund under duty drawback be gradually be reduce .
negotiator be convince that economic relevance duty drawback will therefore diminish over time .
what evidence do commission have to support this argument ?
after more than two year negotiation , free trade agreement be initial on 15 october last year .
throughout negotiate process , commission remain in close contact with parliament .
in this respect , commission welcome resolution on korea vote by parliament in december 200many issue raise in this resolution have be address in free trade agreement .
fta be currently be translate .
objective be to sign agreement in april .
in this case , fta would require ratification all member state before formally enter into force .
provisional application be decide by council on proposal by commission .
it be great importance that we apply agreement as soon as be feasible .
economic benefit fta be mostly in eu poss favor .
with regard to intellectual property rights , fta contain ambitious commitment go beyond wto rule .
these change go in direction simplification , thus implement specific request by european parliament .
at same time , strict rule have be maintain for all sensitive sector .
commission have pay particular attention to create new market access opportunity in korea for european fruit and vegetable .
obviously , fta also open eu market to korean product .
to protect we industry against import increase cause or threaten injury , fta contain effective safeguard mechanism .
this safeguard clause can be invoke from entry into force fta .
thus , maintain it in fta do not accrue any new benefit .
to address such situation , fta contain efficient and rapid dispute settlement mechanism .
commissioner , first , i would like to wish you best luck in you new role .
we find ourselves in economically tricky time , but we know that you be not afraid they .
mr caspary also make this point .
just take look at figure , commissioner .
for every car that we export to south korea from europe , 15 come or way .
this forthcoming free trade agreement with south korea be direct cause this decision .
number and trend be much too alarming .
firstly , we say in my report that we need much better access to korean agricultural market .
and they be not , as one my colleague indicate , insignificant .
we call for non tariff barrier to be tackle and this will be particular benefit to automobile industry .
we want improve trade in environmental goods .
all these thing , parliament ask for .
it would be ludicrous and perverse for we to turn we back on they , have achieve they .
well , course it be not .
yes .
be it good deal for korea ?
yes .
be it good deal , potentially , for world economy ?
yes .
so we should not shilly shally on this we should get on and sign it .
it be almost as though commission be tempt to close deal at any cost .
these two principle will soon constitute precedent for we or trade partner .
every european citizen expect all we , commission and parliament , to demonstrate political sensitivity .
on or hand , with this agreement , we risk introduce subsidy for korean export .
mr president , as you say , this agreement break new ground .
it break new ground , but not necessarily in way in which we talk about it .
just what do these figure mean , however ?
i be elect representative for west france region , and more specifically for brittany .
we be continually tell that europe be indisputable and undisputed leader in fight against global climate change .
you have talk about lisbon strategy , green economy and innovation .
i do not see in this agreement how this will be encourage .
there will be enormous benefit to both europe and korea on signing this deal .
i know there be concern and i have listen to those concern .
we have hear they here tonight about car industry .
so we must look to opportunity and take they , and not negative .
so we must do all we can to break down barrier that be in that particular region .
agreement will show we support for progress .
specifically , how quickly will we be able to utilise this mechanism in case serious market disruption ?
these be consequence gradual liberalisation international trade which they advocate can not ignore .
these complaint give rise to question that continue to go unanswered .
what defense mechanism and safeguard be there against aggressive export ?
when and how will we have way effectively tackle relocation business ?
what be key element this program ?
commissioner , fair economic relation must be establish as matter urgency .
mr president , i do not see this in same way as previous speaker .
i actually welcome free trade agreement with south korea .
country be now world poss eleventh largest economy and eu poss fourth largest trading partner .
south korea be important ally in strategically important area .
in competitive term , china have almost inexhaustible resource in form cheap labor .
consequently , china be also country poss main trade competitor .
this free trade agreement will , as have be mention , remove tariff worth eur 1.6 billion year .
mr president , during last few month , eu have experience several change and transition .
we have have three commissioner on international trade , two eu council president and lisbon treaty .
strongest argument be mainly in area ddb safeguard and non tariff barrier .
even usa have shelve its fta with south korea partly because similar objection from car industry .
this be first major fta .
we need to do it right .
there must be level play field for both party .
please do not get i wrong .
i be strong proponent fta .
employee in eu deserve better .
we do not think that event would prove we right so quickly .
allow i to spot connection there .
we expect answer from you today , commissioner .
where do this figure come from ?
on what study be it base ?
leave aside expect positive effect , however , have negative effect also be take into account ?
commission have draft regulation on method for implement safeguard measure within context this agreement .
proposal put forward provide for complicate procedure for invoke and enforce safeguard clause .
thank you , mr arif , but interpreter be still have problem keep up with you .
they keep signal to i to tell i that they can not keep up with you .
therefore , only you yourself and french speaker in house be follow what you be say .
also , european trade union federation have criticise this free trade agreement .
same korean trade investment promotion agency have calculate this advantage as at least eur 1 300 per car .
therefore , do new commission consider this free trade agreement fair trade agreement ?
we must not be pressurize into act too quickly .
numerous branch industry , include many from poland , be complain about this agreement .
therefore , it be my conviction that we should act as follow .
i expect commission to produce very comprehensive analysis consequence bring this agreement into force .
secondly , this treaty involve only one country , so it be bilateral agreement .
what be reason for this two year time lapse commissioner ?
i would also like to receive more detail regard any update on this aspect you mention .
labor clause in contract be good , but they do not go far enough .
case opel in antwerp have be mention several time .
who will benefit from this ?
be it possible that this be advance effect free trade agreement ?
another sector with problem which have not receive as much attention be shipbuilding industry .
question on basis rule 149 8 rule procedure
we will widen this and use it even more in future .
item be hereby close .
new legislative framework on european citizensinitiative be undoubtedly welcome .
there have long be case for citizen to have access to such instrument .
this be only way that eu will successfully move closer to its citizen and become more democratic .
treaty lisbon give citizen european union right to propose legislative initiative .
citizen european union eagerly await this .
european citizensinitiative be mainly about greater involvement citizen in create european law .
organiser initiative must be publicly responsible for transparency concern financing campaign to collect signature .
those vote reflect noticeable lack communication between european union and its citizen .
commission receive as few as 159 response from individual .
however , we must make sure that guarantee against abuse be meet .
it should be simple , understandable and easily accessible .
in this way , work put into its preparation and effort invest will not be waste .
situation in tibet debate
next item be commission poss statement on situation in tibet .
it be evident that difference with china on tibet remain .
eu position do not leave any room for misinterpretation .
therefore , let i stress eu respect sovereignty and territorial integrity china , include tibet .
we respect one chinapolicy .
dialogue should also address participation all tibetan in decision make .
for eu , tibet be human rights issue .
we welcome that tibetan side have reiterate its firm commitment not to seek separation or independence .
from we side , i can guarantee eu poss wholehearted support to such process .
finally , president obama recently meet with dalaus lama in white house .
we look forward to see baroness ashton invite dalaus lama and meeting he in brussels .
in or word , we defend human rights and we also defend dialogue , meeting and agreement .
pez garrido poss presence in this house to talk about all matter be almost superhuman .
we must not give up .
china poss shoulder be broad enough to enable it do so .
we be also support as be mr andrikien creation coordinator for tibet .
this be battle for freedom which therefore concern identity we continent .
they do not even listen to what mr andrikienwa say .
this be not true .
there must be no repeat this .
it would appear that china do not want anything from talk .
china want to continue to violate tibetan cultural , religious and language rights .
we can not accept cultural genocide this sort .
month ago , i go to dharamsalum and i meet dalaus lama .
i be convince that i have to propose in parliament that we should discuss situation in tibet .
despite this , claim persist .
i be call on european union to condemn these remark and raise matter with china .
if european union be not bold enough to defend tibet , not many or will .
we need to keep this matter alive in european parliament .
reference be also make here to fact that we need special representative for tibet .
we have all kind special representative .
uighur jihadist have also exploit recent unrest in tibet to foment they own violence against chinese government .
this mean that commission recognize china poss right to occupy tibet , which be very serious matter .
european parliament should also listen to tibetan community .
event push we towards make some decision in this house .
this week , google have abandon china .
on or hand , we can not say that situation be good .
tibetan be forbid from do anything to rescue they own culture , identity and religion .
chinese authority say that dalaus lama be private person .
today , 21st meeting tibetan task force for sino tibetan negotiation begin in dharamsalum .
this be sad , indeed .
it be clear that only last solution would be autonomy , and indeed expand , true autonomy .
it be not enough to formulate criticism .
it would be good if commission , m carine ashton and council think this through .
nor be it ever debate in council foreign minister .
therefore , in order for we to succeed , criticism on matter tibet be not enough .
we also need conception and mediation .
after all , tibet be also important challenge .
we may agree or disagree on tibet , but , really , mr ashton should be here .
today , mr ashton be like pontius pilate , who wash he hand .
this be embarrassing .
ro mr kaczmarek speak earlier about protest in 200national security can not be use as grounds for abolish fundamental civil rights .
if we fail to adopt such position , we know what happen .
we have see it in past where chinese communist leader try to intimidate eu member state individually .
i believe that this issue must be deal with during summit meeting .
i agree with high representative in this regard .
what be european union poss reaction to very event which we be talk about at moment ?
, you say you be appeal to both side for dialogue .
be that joke ?
do you really mean to appeal to representative tibet for that dialogue ?
i be under impression that they be willing for this .
madam president , tibet and its cultural heritage be we common treasure .
sadly , this be not case .
this can be prevent only by grant they genuine autonomous status .
i would note , commissioner , you statement that tibet be we legitimate concern .
china can become truly great only by show respect towards its minority .
i know personally what godless and materialistic communist regime be capable .
global public can not remain silent .
i myself be member friend tibet group in european parliament .
i appeal to commission not to forget this hard press group people in its program .
hypocrite who be dependent on something on those cheap goods from china .
i be refer to appointment special coordinator for tibet .
let we do this .
let we do it now .
i therefore disagree with those who think that this issuewa not concern .
we in european union can not go on put up with this game , far less fuel it .
we must also be clear in this respect .
otherwise , nothing will be credible in term human rights .
madam president , on 10 march , we celebrate 51st anniversary popular uprising in tibet .
we european keep learn from he holiness , dalaus lama .
even you , commissioner , can not render international law null and void .
i believe this to be concern that really pull on heart string every european citizen .
we be very quick to judge small country that commit transgression .
we react strongly , and we pass we judgment on small country very quickly .
we tread on eggshell , both politically and diplomatically .
we be likewise unable to put pressure on china through million in development aid .
i therefore expect high representative .
sl i be one few who recently have opportunity to visit tibet .
river have be polluted and motorway which blot tibetan landscape have appear .
however , there be some progress under way in tibet .
moreover , we discussion have underline necessity for both party to promptly resume dialogue .
dozen civilian be kill and several hundred be wound .
result these effort be still not satisfactory .
we have , doubtless , not even hear about many similar incident .
this would be follow by specific action and , i hope , visible result .
media , today , be full information about china .
in this context , media have , recently , also be write about tibet .
however , can he strategy be successful ?
economic interest can not be make reason to forget persecute and suffer .
since that time , tibetan have not be allow to commemorate that day freely .
in eastern europe , where i come from , story be familiar one .
however , what we be talk about here be more than that .
next item be one minute speech in accordance with rule 1rule 150 state that we may spend maximum 30 minute on this item .
we have more than 74 request to speak under this item .
that will clearly not be possible .
thirty minute and 74 speaker for one minute will simply not work .
all those who have not be grant speak time be inform this in advance by e mail .
therefore , they do not need to be here to wait in vain for they speaking time .
this be only possible way to enable debate to proceed in orderly manner .
therefore , those who have be grant speak time can now begin straight away .
we all know how sudan have suffer under he rule violence .
it be difficult to say how free election will be .
on monday , al bashir threaten to expel international election observer .
he say that if they interfere in sudan poss affair , he would cut they finger off .
we know that sudan be country in need .
it be my hope that election in sudan will create condition for .
in my opinion , government that have be unable to resolve unemployment stabilisation problem should not receive praise .
italian citizen have come up with clean parliamentprogram .
would it not be better to improve service provide in biarritz by introduce non pollute form transport ?
i should like to know which measure president be go to take with regard to this extension .
mr zuev be kill about week ago in kaliningrad .
he be well know journalist and blogger .
this be not first case journalist be kill in russia .
since year 2000 , there have be at least dozen such case .
in we dialogue with russia , we should always draw attention to this .
bill indictment state that company have be involve in long term bribery process .
as result , apart from financial crisis , we also have moral crisis .
greece poss problem be mainly political .
president note that there be problem with microphone
it have worn down resistance greek society and economic strength greek .
as i say , its problem be mainly political .
we be not ask for money from any european citizen .
for seven month , there be anice age .
apart from sanction , there be also result .
if we remember this , we will have excellent future , with safe and pure food originate here .
de madam president , many thanks once again to rapporteur for he excellent report .
as result , they play important part in development rural area within european union .
european union poss agricultural product already meet high quality standard .
european standard have global reputation for be very high .
this will be incentive for producer to focus more on quality and food safety .
consumer have right to enjoy agricultural product in eu without concern and without compunction .
purpose european union be not to be concern about curvature cucumber .
same apply to size pizza .
i would seriously warn against overregulation here .
if we want regional economic cycle , we need to focus on quality and not on degree curvature .
therefore , let we focus on quality and not packaging unit .
ro let i begin by congratulating rapporteur for tackle this issue agricultural product quality .
demand market be diverse and be increase all time .
face with these new commercial challenge , european farmer poss main asset be quality .
however , there be few aspect capable enhance quality .
that be why effort be be make to safeguard they , include with label .
ro agricultural product quality policy may provide solution for many farmer .
. this backdrop , scott? report be welcome , as be package announce by commissioner ciolo ?
agricultural product quality policy and reduction in european agriculture budget be two incompatible idea .
quality logo should , in principle , be view as beneficial if they be voluntary .
this rob producer and processor they entrepreneurial freedom and also narrow choice for consumer .
we need to be careful that good intention do not descend into excessive bureaucracy .
as be rightly emphasise in report , this have to change .
de madam president , control foodstuff be utopian fantasy .
pressure for control and consequence be , too , it seem .
we be thus in right old stew !
we have see result this recently in listerium contaminate cheese scandal .
they be completely overwhelm by label jungle .
quality conscious customer be prepare to pay more for high quality food .
question be for how long , if rogue trader be also operate in this area .
you be right about that .
designationmountain produceus therefore particularly important .
i would like to address two point .
however , producer want and need these rule .
we should take that into account in we debate and also in vote tomorrow .
it be important that information on quality goods reach consumer .
we know that every product allow on to market must meet minimum standard .
consumer must know what they be buy and for what they be pay .
i would like to point out key importance improve designation origin for food .
every agricultural product in eu must be clearly label with origin raw material .
consumer must not be dupe by fraudulent label .
take china , for example .
import seed arrive in austrium and then so calledpress seed oilus sell there .
in my view , protect designation origin and geographical indication system must be implement .
food quality and safety be among main challenge that we must resolve in future .
it be therefore not my intention to merge for sake it .
we therefore have to see which be best way to successfully differentiate we product from or .
madam president , lady and gentleman .
i should like to begin by talk very briefly about land .
european parliament will continue to fight for protection both farmer and consumer .
i be pleased to note recognition this indication .
market globalisation and economic and financial crisis that have strike europe have not spare agricultural sector .
to emerge from this , we need to focus on quality and safety we produce .
agricultural product quality policy be not static policy , separate from or policy connect with agriculture .
g20 labor and employment minister meet washington , 20 21 april debate
these figure speak for themselves .
indeed , current crisis highlight most painful weakness we increasingly interconnect global economy .
there be now clear consensus on need for global action to solve global problem .
accordingly , g20 leader agree to build employment orient framework for future economic growth .
this be all very welcome .
this unprecedented meeting will take place in washington dc on 20 and 21 april .
commission and spanish presidency will also participate .
social partnersinvolvement can bring tremendous add value .
commission be ready to share this experience with european union poss international partner .
commission will keep parliament inform about progress make at washington dc meeting .
this be necessity , because there can be no social integration without integration via workplace .
this meeting we be have today owe much to chair committee on employment , mr ber?s .
act god prevent she from be here today .
i be go to speak on behalf we both .
it be not enough to regulate financial product we must get to very bottom wrongdoing .
dangerous game be be play between minister for finance and minister for employment and social affair .
commission praise we fiscal discipline but we be hemorrhage job .
we be balance book but we worker be pay price .
it be time to put end to regression social and labor rights that we be see .
without creation new job with rights , there can be no way out this crisis .
we know that this will have long term social as well as political consequence .
around world , this go hand in hand with extremism , which pose long term threat as well .
however , i believe that even this be more than anything we have do in past .
madam president , as we be all say , financial crisis have hit ordinary people very hard .
i just hope we do have those positive outcome .
we know there be record unemployment in many country across world .
we have get to look at real way get people into work into real job .
training program , for instance , have to be adequate to actually cover need at moment .
work have be do in those or country , so why be we not learn from they ?
we must make sure core ilo convention be actually implement .
we must make sure un convention on rights person with disability be implement .
we must make sure that those who be not protect at moment be protect in future .
create job must be priority for europe .
realistic , specific , quantifiable target , both long term and immediate , urgently need to be set .
we urgently need to be able to safeguard decent work for citizen europe .
we urgently need to be able to safeguard employment and pension rights worker .
we be close to forget obvious that work be lever for growth .
this be what will create condition for sustainable recovery that provide wealth job .
social progress be prerequisite for end economic crisis , not or way around .
small and medium size enterprise be shut down en masse .
number long term unemployed be also grow constantly .
this week , in my country , lithuanium , 300 000 people be register unemployed .
my country have never experience this before in 20 year since it become independent .
therefore , i hope that such concrete decision be take at this meeting .
it be major step forward that labor minister be meet in g20 context .
bank have be recapitalise and financial stability have enjoy priority .
now we have to prioritise job creation .
this be sound standard for we in move forward on employment and social relation .
unfortunately , failure to recognize this reality be evident in current eu 2020 strategy .
we can not go back to extreme day rampant capitalism world oliver twist !
otherwise , eu 2020 strategy , just like lisbon strategy , will end in failure .
fight against tuberculosis debate
next item be statement from commission on fight against tuberculosis .
however , for too long , we have mistakenly lower guard against tuberculosis .
this amount to about 16 death day .
this be simply unacceptable and require action by all concerned sector and stakeholder .
it be unacceptable because tuberculosis be preventable and curable disease that should not lead to such dramatic consequence .
commission have launch number initiative over past year to strengn capacity to tackle tuberculosis .
in 2000 , tuberculosis be include in list priority disease under eu wide surveillance .
this have improve we share knowledge and monitoring epidemiological situation .
since 2002 , more than eur 124 million have be allocate to these effort .
but , as tuberculosis be not constrain by border , we have to support country beyond european union .
however , commission can not succeed in this challenge alone .
tuberculosis be seventh most common cause death in world .
globally , there be 9.4 million new case tuberculosis in 2008 and 1.8 million death .
person be infect by tuberculosis somewhere in world every second .
ultimately , we be european union and we strength lie in unity .
sv that be what ban ki moon say today , on world tuberculosis day .
he be right , course .
however , as commission point out , people in europe be also die tuberculosis .
mr president , medical progress have not yet overcome tuberculosis .
consequently , it be wrongly consider to be disease that affect only poor country .
this underestimate way in which it be spread , especially in central and eastern europe .
furthermore , multiple resistant strain offer little hope end to this scourge in short term .
number case tuberculosis have be decrease within eu .
this reduction be link to success national plan to fight tuberculosis .
in some country , however , it have recently be show that disease be resurgent .
various action plan promote by european commission be step in right direction .
i would like to highlight partnership between europe and develop country in carry out clinical trial .
strengn role clinical and scientific research be vital in fight against tuberculosis .
i also call on you to encourage greater investment in scientific research in fight against tuberculosis .
i take great pleasure and interest in listen to speech honorable member .
we be determine to achieve we target in order to control tuberculosis disease 
effect global financial and economic crisis on develop country and on development cooperation short presentation
financial crisis add to this fragile situation in which these country find themselves .
in fact , all area activity in these country have be damage .
economic growth , which will be much lower in 2009 than in previous year , have be damage .
trade have decrease , which will weaken these countriescurrent account balance .
at same time , emigrant remittance have fall and official development assistance have also be reduce .
one common feature be increase in financing need many country .
on 21 april , commission will publish its yearly spring development package proposal to member state .
this year , focus will be on action that remain necessary to achieve mdg .
package will adopt comprehensive approach and define action plan for accelerate progress towards mdg .
ro economic and financial crisis have also hit moldova , develop country , very hard .
direct investment need to be encourage .
cost money transfer make by emigrant from country they work in must be reduce .
agreement be reach today by prime minister vlad filat during donor conference .
i be glad that mr guerrero have take up these proposal and i congratulate he on he splendid report .
sv mr president , i would like to thank rapporteur for he important report .
in few daystime , acp eu joint parliamentary assembly will meet in tenerife .
they need trade , but we policy counteract establishment healthy market for agricultural product in develop country .
eu have show leadership say commissioner , but we can do much better .
it be matter fair trade , commissioner .
yet it be foreign debt that continue to be principal drain on resource develop country .
cancel debt be simply matter justice .
keep to speaking time , too , be matter fairness .
country europe be get themselves ever deeper into debt in order to restart they economy .
vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 20written statement rule 149
by implement these action , european union must be leader and act more resolutely .
economic crisis be already affect population directly , while unemployment be on rise in develop country .
eu funding program be most comprehensive and inclusive among financial aid scheme available globally .
sit be close at 23.15
this make we aware that problem terrorism in europe have not yet be solve .
lady in whiteare mor and wife imprison opposition activist .
in 2005 , european parliament award lady in white sakharov prize .
we join today with those heroic woman , and we be think about they and they difficult situation .
my report on ecb poss 2008 annual report be draft in this context .
i hope that good balance have be find .
financial and economic crisis have see worst global economic decline since 1930 .
most member state be experience rise budgetary deficit and debt .
i believe that ecb have respond fairly well to crisis .
primary function ecb be to maintain price stability .
instead , many bank have use liquidity to buttress they own position .
to justified public revulsion , it have allow they to make bonus payment as well .
however , i will leave it to my colleague here perhaps to amplify on this .
this be something to build upon .
we must strengn that accountability .
economic situation be matter major concern for citizen europe and for all we .
i would like to present report against this background .
this be price which we have to pay in order to emerge from crisis .
report poss message in this respect be very clear .
we must return to path take by stability and growth pact as quickly as possible .
we can not pass on this level debt to we child and grandchild .
i would like to summarise briefly we proposal in this respect .
firstly , we need effective instrument for economic coordination .
secondly , structural dependency euro area on finite resource must be bring to end .
thirdly , it be essential that financial market be effectively regulate after this crisis .
instead , individual member state be expect to use ridiculous interest rate in order to finance they debt .
report also call for implementation country by country report system for corporate income .
we be ask you to submit corresponding proposal .
however , this give i opportunity to discuss current situation at end debate .
first , on economic development and monetary policy over past year .
in particular , we scale back number , frequency and maturity longer term refinancing operation .
i therefore welcome repeat support by committee on economic and monetary affair for we quarterly monetary dialogue .
we consider ecb to be one world poss most transparent central bank .
certain financial instrument which be introduce for hedge should not be misuse for speculation .
let i say just word on outlook for emu during challenge time .
economic recovery be in progress , but this do not mean that crisis be over .
for another , we be still face numerous challenge regard reform we financial system .
finance must play constructive role , and not destructive one , in we economy .
litmus test for constructive role be that finance serve real economy .
to ensure such role , we still need to improve function financial system considerably further .
thus far , great deal attention have be focus on banking sector .
we have to contain systemic disruption that lead to economic hardship for people europe .
within europe poss economic and monetary union , there be clear allocation responsibility .
commitment ecb , strategy ecb and its track record be consistent .
policy maker at national level must keep public finances sound and they economy competitive .
monetary union in europe be far more , in my opinion , than monetary arrangement .
it be union share destiny .
speaker add in french and german we share destiny in common .
this destiny be for we common good , and it be vision we founding far .
monetary union be not matter convenience .
i believe we often play down achievement that europe have attain .
but they have generally work well , even in most difficult time .
i trust that european institution and process have remain effective during financial crisis .
let i conclude .
global financial crisis have bring fresh challenge to which we in europe have rise .
today , europe face further pivotal decision .
for this we need strengn surveillance as again be say by rapporteur , and strengn cooperation .
we also need to revive sense common purpose , share ideal that motivate we founding far .
they endeavor be visionary and all that we see in today poss world confirm they lucidity .
when we prepare we annual statement , we know that select issue would be topical .
they might , however , have become somewhat too topical recently .
let i congratulate both rapporteur , edward scicluna and sven giegold , for they excellent report .
since 1999 , euro area have mostly be area economic stability .
it have shield we citizen from economic turbulence .
this moment may indeed be turn point in greek fiscal history and economic development .
greek crisis have demonstrate need for enhanced economic governance .
this be already recognize and legal base provide in lisbon treaty .
therefore , integrate and forward look approach focus on policy action and clear operational arrangement be need .
i also count on you support in this matter .
we can also make better use exist instrument .
this have be use in past , probably too rarely .
that be second core element reinforce economic governance .
by and large , i share view rapporteur in this regard .
today , worst may be over .
economic recovery be now in progress but it be still fragile and not self sustain .
unemployment have not yet change for better .
same apply to consolidation public finances , which be prerequisite for sustainable growth .
these cloud will overshadow we economic landscape in come year .
we must do we utmost to clear sky and bring back growth .
therefore , this be indeed no time for business as usual .
instead , this be time for change in step to promote sustainable growth and job creation .
i have learn two main lesson from this crisis .
on one hand , economic and monetary union have show how useful it be .
euro , stable common currency , have play part real monetary shield .
euro area have therefore become more attractive , as case iceland show .
from this i draw second lesson , which be that we should strengn european economic governance .
today , only genuine european economic policy be monetary policy .
there be limit coordination budget policy .
reduce public debt remain fundamental commitment , as it concern we child poss future .
let we be austere , but let we also be inventive .
mr president , lady and gentleman , mr giegold poss report be particularly significant give current macro economic debate .
this crisis be far from behind we .
they will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tension .
giegold report have merit draw attention to some these macro economic imbalance .
we hold long discussion with they and in end , agree on many compromise amendment .
i would like to talk to you today about euro .
it be , in fact , only major western currency that have not make its user poorer .
euro pose no risk to mediterranean economy .
we in euro area must not penalize country that export most .
neverless , under no circumstance must its export strength be weaken .
those who do best can not be penalize .
i would like , start from where we be today , to take look forward .
where be we ?
second , we can not ignore fact that we already have huge and deepen social inequality .
so what we believe be that we should really switch gear .
course .
what do that mean ?
greece have 4 % its gdp go to military spending .
they have get air force that be as big as luftwaffe .
i mean , how come ?
it be such tiny country and they be arm themselves like hell .
but if we just look at expenditure side , we will not succeed .
we need to rebalance tax income away from labor income towards or form income , include capital income .
and we can not do that just by ask country to coordinate they policy .
we need more integration .
so i believe that europe be now at critical juncture .
choice be between higher degree integration , not just coordination , and decline .
lesson that i take from copenhagen be not just that we miss climate agreement .
it be that europe have prove to be irrelevant if it be not act together .
we spend too much time coordinate , too little time act together .
so that would be we contribution to this debate .
however , euro do not sit in isolation .
while they may be unite by common currency , attitude towards save and spending vary considerably .
join monetary union do not unite completely different culture and tradition fiscal policy .
uk perspective have lot to say on difference in fiscal policy .
fundamentally , money to fund public sector do not magically appear .
it come from tax receipt from private sector .
germany realize this .
hence , it be now in strong position for recovery .
ultimately , public sector have do its job in crisis .
it bail out bank and step up when private sector fail .
now it be turn private sector to replenish coffer .
on one hand , we be talk about community with common destiny .
that be preposterous !
most importantly , this would be admission failure which would amount to kowtow to financial sector .
take this route would be equivalent drive eu project into wall .
euro can not provide answer to different level productivity in individual economy .
major exporter such as germany be force greek economic policy to its knee .
therefore , this also represent crisis in eu economic and competition policy .
this be why we be call for ban on financial assistance for eu member state to be lift .
this be what we be call for .
mr president , 25 march be birthday both europe and greece .
on 25 march 1957 , european union be bear under treaty rome .
on 25 march 1821 , greece be bear .
many people will say it serve greece right and it should pay for its mistake .
yes , certain people must be call to account for this .
thank you , sir .
you time have run out .
de mr president , i would like to raise point order .
however , inflation be also cause for concern and you be make good progress in this area .
as austrian , i would like to advise against germany bash that have be take place here .
everyone should be aware germany have be source great deal stability in past .
it should not now be punish because it have achieve better result in many area than or country .
mr trichet and mr rehn be same opinion .
mr scicluna poss report reflect this approach .
like tanker on high sea , ecb must stay on correct course .
this should be important criterion for future assessment or measure take by central bank .
gravity situation have be accurately describe .
this morning , i have hear so many speech exalt virtue euro .
adon abbondio europeus no use to we .
if europe do not show courage today , when will it have to show courage ?
but there be indicator beyond stability and growth pact that need respect too .
greater fiscal coordination link to macro economic stability be option .
but this have be try , course .
so we know lesson exert discipline in time surplus be even harder than police deficit .
and , just like in financial market , failure to do so end in crisis .
this , too , do not necessarily have deficit trigger .
often , it have simply be reinvest in asset bear higher interest .
and i dare say some these be even recirculate on repo to ecb .
no doubt in some quarter , such activity be even view as deserving bonus .
it identify element social cohesion which be not present in similar debate in european parliament .
euro should be accompany by minimum social security indicator for social cohesion .
that be clear from various thing be say in greece , much which be inaccurate .
that be clear from eurostat statistics it be approximately 90 % in both 2007 and 200of course there be wastage , but people be also be recruit to public sector in various form .
these day , imf be right organization to help greece out crisis .
if that do not work , then we need to be decisive and cut gordian knot .
country that be not play by rule euro area must leave game .
mr president , let we try and learn from this situation .
when it join euro , greece be as unpredictable as oracle at delphus .
figure it submit be unclear and unreliable .
that be turn world on its head .
anyone who submit unsound figure can not point accuse finger at anybody else .
if not , should you not have know that ?
i hope you can give i straight answer to that question .
capitalist crisis have result in spiral deterioration in live standard worker .
it be harsh policy exercise solely on basis criterion profitability capital .
it have channel over eur 1 trillion to bank and monopoly group .
let we bring it all down to earth just little bit shall we ?
unemployment , youth unemployment in iberian peninsula and many eurozone country be chronic .
it have be at 30 40 % for year .
nothing to do with crisis at all .
complete disaster .
gdp per capita in usa be mile ahead european union .
gdp in pacific rim be mile ahead gdp in union .
no , euro have not be successful at all .
it be already fail .
it be already crumble before we eye .
just look at some economic basics .
there be no lender .
this be impossible in global , in currency management , wher it be optimal currency zone or not .
there be no coordinate fiscal policy so it be doom to failure and it be fail as we speak .
let i just remind everybody here about something else if i may .
far too many we .
ro mafia be major cause crisis .
i will give you few example from my own country , romania .
since 1990 , approximately 6 000 company value at eur 700 billion have be privatise fraudulently .
unfortunately , only eur 7 billion , or 1 % this money , have be receive so far .
this be no longer market economy , but jungle economy .
just like 100 year ago , balkan peninsula be sit on powder keg .
flame social protest may quickly spread from greece to or country in region .
starvation be most powerful electoral factor in history .
however , there be one hope salvation radical solution be require at such historic crossroads .
it be not under control mafia need to be , but under ground .
mr rehn , i would like to remind you that you have some huge task ahead .
we need more automate system .
we do not need economic governance under control finance minister .
i would like to make two remark about what mr trichet have say on euro area .
secondly , eu have largely succeed in balance its account , thanks to country in surplus .
they have to export they goods .
that be not sufficient .
we have enough to do ourselves with budgetary consolidation .
it be important not to underestimate work involve .
this be not true european policy .
therefore , i would like to wish commission courage and give my warm thanks to ecb .
without doubt , basic responsibility for this situation lie with greece and it have fully assume it .
however , there be or collective responsibility .
common currency have provide great deal , but it also have serious weakness .
alternative , if it fail , would , course , be frightening prospect .
ecb have be bastion strength when financial storm have hit .
greece poss problem and those or euro area country can not be blame on euro .
careless expansion public expenditure will result in problem regardless choice currency .
deficit be still extremely large .
i would like to finish by say something about speculation .
language war do not suit style bank .
only two be in euroland .
my point view , therefore , will be different .
do this mean we be lazy ?
greece be currently go through crisis because it enter that oasis stability too soon .
we should avoid such inconsistency .
economic situation in numerous country be clearly negative .
measure be take to address deficit be exacerbate crisis .
mr trichet and mr rehn and i be speak institutionally do you not see crisis come ?
sign be there .
in my opinion , problem in european union and in greece be not one sound finances .
as such , i would say to you that what be need be change to stability pact .
financial assistance for greece should come primarily from international monetary fund imf .
imf have itself say that it be in excellent position to help greece .
necessity and desirability set up emf be dubious .
it be really up to council now to make move .
twenty member state currently have excessive deficit .
greater economic union may make difference .
global imbalance need to be correct .
european union be one most balanced region .
that could come under threat unless its competitiveness be strengn and there be greater international monetary cooperation .
effort and courage greece deserve clear and resolute support .
it be question common interest and uncertainty harm all european .
subsidiarity and solidarity be two side same coin european currency .
i have repeat it in spanish , which be one european union poss global language .
public fund many member state have decline as result this crisis .
to deal with this issue , irish government take decisive action in year 2008 and 200unchecked , ireland poss deficit be head towards 14 % gdp .
government poss action stabilise deficit at 11.6 % gdp in 20 action take by government have gain recognition in international market .
in many way , ireland be ahead many or country in its fiscal adjustment .
we have to ask wher some state should have enter euro area as early as they do .
european taxpayer in many country may , today , pay great deal for this haste .
it would be good if we could draw some conclusion from this lesson for future .
it be true that many be demand economic governance .
greek crisis be tell it be germany that have control and be impose its demand .
ecb will have important role in this area .
pact poss main aim be prevention .
it be mean to provide multilateral supervision budgetary development use early warn system .
estonia be practically only eu member state that currently satisfy maastricht criterion .
mr president , 2008 be extremely important year for european and indeed global economy .
this be no easy year for ecb , which have to face number challenge .
i agree that 2008 be instrumental and that those responsible have rise to this occasion .
quite clearly , i be sorry to hear this .
this be what we must take into account .
we must take this into account for two reason .
this be spirit that we have to discover .
this be magic panacea that we need .
in search for remedy , key indicator be sustainability public finances and deficit .
we just have to observe strict budget discipline in public finances .
firstly , we should not devote debate on public finances to issue relate to austerity alone .
we also need to focus on what we can do to initiate growth and combat unemployment .
in many country , cut in public expenditure be need .
there be still much to do in this regard .
transparency be not only excellent way to counter harmful risk take behavior on financial market .
ecb should lead way in this area and take immediate measure to make its work more transparent .
good first step would be to begin to publish minute ecb council meeting .
openness should also be key principle in establishment european systemic risk board esrb .
we must not allow financial crisis to slow down switch to green economy .
only by make these kind investment can we create growth that be sustainable in long term .
in 2009 , monetary instability could have weaken political solidity european union .
but for how much longer ?
solidarity go hand in hand with solidity in emotionally charge context sovereign debt market .
political prevaricate recent week have not only damage greece .
it have seriously shake confidence in euro .
non assistance to country in danger be undermine monetary stability whole euro area .
beyond emergency , let we finally give euro instrument it need .
we need representation outside euro area at all level , in all body , include international financial institution .
why be president eurogroup not in g20 ?
we must welcome they with enthusiasm , not with petty mindedness .
contrive to exclude euro area member amount to abandon ambition strong europe in world .
this be price euro poss continue success .
let we think about how this illness , which we call crisis , arise .
cause crisis be activity which be contrary to market principle speculative activity .
globalisation have lead to establishment world financial institution and global finance market .
it be pity that warn from commission be too gentle .
some member state behave like child , hide they misdeed .
this kind behavior can not be basis community or we integration .
we must take action so that cost crisis do not fall on weakest and poorest .
european union solidarity oblige we also to support country which have be worst hit by crisis .
you have be competent , independent and consistent .
you and you staff have be calming influence in trouble time .
mr rehn , you have make some very encourage statement over last few day .
we should do everything possible to continue on path that you have take .
euro be stabilise force , even in time crisis .
on contrary , it be part solution .
there can be no reform without euro .
greece can not be give subsidy , but it want support for implement its reform and savings plan .
no one have say that nothing could be do .
we have monetary union , but we do not have economic union .
to achieve economic union , we need political will member state rather than advice .
this be what we be call on member state to do and we expect they to show commitment .
we must continue on this route in interest euro .
pl mr president , last year be extremely turbulent one for euro area .
during this period , world experience its biggest economic crisis for year .
resolution we be consider at moment be part this debate .
i would like to draw attention to one aspect it .
therefore , let we not exclude new member state from such important debate .
we have have two speed europeslogan .
my country , slovakium , be no exception to rule .
unemployment have rise above 13 % .
vast majority population still feel positive about euro .
we think it be important therefore to maintain strength and prestige euro .
parliament must help commission and ecb in they effort in order to avoid failure in this endeavor .
support for economic activity , in particular , small and medium size enterprise , be not coordinate either .
my party be pleased that uk remain outside eurozone .
however , keep we own currency be only part answer .
single currency have not provide solution to all internal and external imbalance which have occur .
those group which be not responsible for crisis must not now be make to bear cost .
if we do not invest in people , we will not have future in europe .
this be why i be call for emphasis to be put on social aspect in future .
globalisation be compelling euro area to play effective role with regard to financial policy .
we be not go back to business as usual .
we have to remain extremely alert .
i also get message on growth and job , which be very strong message from parliament .
i fully agree with that .
we absolutely need full and complete implementation stability and growth pact .
this be key issue .
i do not want to elaborate more on greece and various issue at stake .
let i only say that greece have role model , and role model be ireland .
i want to stress that .
you can trust we .
we can prove that .
this be not theory .
these be fact these be figure .
they must draw consequence from this nationally .
they benefit from belong to euro area .
we be college .
govern council be pertinent entity .
it be govern council which count .
i have listen to you view very carefully .
i would like to consult you and move forward soon with concrete proposal .
there be two line action in reinforce economic governance which be essence .
binding policy recommendation will also be use in this regard .
this be need to prevent accumulation imbalance .
mr president , few point first .
we have see that recent recession be prove to be challenge .
however tension in euro area be not new and be well know .
we know we be not yet optimal currency area .
however , that be why we have to be innovative .
we have to follow sensible economic principle and policy .
course , they must be couch in line with european social cohesion principle .
some can be execute in short term and or in medium term .
we need to ensure that crisis this magnitude do not occur again .
mr president , follow this debate , i would like to make three quick point .
there be difference which be quite clear and i think we have to be careful .
some country have cost increase which be too high , and it be good that you be act .
i urge you not to be blind in one eye and i urge my colleague likewise .
look at greece and stability program , which be praise .
if you praise irish effort , you can not compare it to situation in greece .
people in greece feel they should not suffer because thing they have not cause .
otherwise , program will be not accept and it will also fail for economic reason .
we have to make sure that program be socially just and it be not yet socially just .
vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 20written statement rule 149
there be lesson to be learn from current eurozone crisis .
better coordination would enhance euro area stability .
sgp need to be respect strictly , but i think it should be revise .
preventive arm should be strengn .
without function eurozone , overcome crisis would have be much slower and uneven .
this apply also for those member state which have not yet join eurozone .
there be general agreement that economic crisis be logical outcome widespread crisis value .
those who have join eurozone be expect to bear higher responsibility for balance they expense and income .
it do not make sense to take role suppose victim financial speculation or economic mafia .
almost all european economy have sin against principle sound and balanced fiscal policy .
first cause this justified criticism be objective bank .
all this only confirm harmfulness current concept european central bank .
report must therefore be reject .
european union as whole and euro area in particular be in grave situation .
greece be on verge bankruptcy and spain and portugal be also in difficulty .
because seriousness situation , new proposal be constantly be make .
on one hand , people be talk about give european monetary fund extensive rights intervention .
however , take another huge step towards centralised european superstate will not solve exist problem .
on contrary , it will further exacerbate they .
european union should stop expose itself voluntarily to problem we financial policy .
euro be anchor to which member state economy be tie .
action by any member state which weaken euro be unacceptable .
i consider it essential that every country fulfil condition set up for euro area .
second european roma summit motion for resolution table see minute

this be in paragraph 108 ruling .
consequently , it believe that i can no longer cite prejudice .
fact remain that it be order we parliament to pay two third legal cost .
this decision therefore constitute scathing rejection partisan tactic that deprive i parliamentary immunity .
under pressure , rapporteur resort to crude procedural trick .

ecb annual report for 2008
vote time continue
cause this situation be vary .
that be fact .
economic and social disadvantage roma have yet again be ascribe to so call intolerance and discrimination .
they value and norm be directly at odds with we own .
we can observe similar tendency in we country now .
i disagree with that .
contrary be true .
however , this parliament be call for even more so call decentralised agency .
i repeat that , as i see it , we have too many these already .
next year poss budget must not be draw up as if these be ordinary time .
unfortunately , economic crisis be not yet over , and we can not ignore it .
european union be very good at spend money at spend or people poss money .
we be much more careful with latter than with former .
that explain what be happen in europe today .
all member state be look for budget reduction .
eu citizen and discerning consumer must therefore be fully inform as to they advantage .
i therefore fully support introduction european quality logo for product originate exclusively from eu .
logo officially recognize effort european farmer and provide protection for intellectual property at international level .
i firmly believe that this will help many rural area which have no or development opportunity .
there should be clear divide .
these be reason why i vote for this report .
mr president , may i also thank mr scott? for work in this important report .
it also support introduction comprehensive and compulsory legislation forplace farminglabelling .
we have do good job .
my compliment to those member who have work on this dossier .
mr president , in principle , i have no problem with idea quality logo .

nl mr president , as parliament , we ought to think twice before make proposal .
we ought to be make proposal for policy that will solve problem , not exacerbate they .
that be my first point .
i will be very brief with my second point .
reproductive health organization support abortion as one way control birth rate .
in my opinion , eu waste financial resource on birth control , which do not solve poverty .
that be why i have vote against paragraph 7 and against entire report .
i think it be john maynard keyne who wrotehe who control currency control country .
i promise that be only time i be go to quote keyne approvingly .
in fact , let i give you higher and better authority even than john maynard keyne .
i refer you to gospel st matw , chapter i be sure you will remember this .

mr president , i vote against this report because it be silly report .
it be irrelevant report .
you will now collect about usd 6 trillion worth capital .

so , like or speaker , we object to that and vote against that section .
da mr president , we in danish people poss party vote against this report .

it be danish electorate and not economist in frankfurt who should decide this .

explanation vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 rule procedure
large majority voting in favor in competent parliamentary committee confirm measure poss apparent soundness .
give this , i see no reason to vote against mobilisation fund in this case .
this support be essential for help unemployed and victim relocation that occur in context globalisation .
sum be not big for eu but they will alleviate hardship lithuanian worker be face .
we believe that member state should help they own redundant worker .
we must therefore vote for fund to be use appropriately for or member state .
it be thought lithuanian worker sacrifice on altar globalisation that prompt i to abstain .
however , what little be give may relieve they pain .
logic european globalisation adjustment fund be still intolerable noneless .
in kingdom eurocrat , clear conscience come cheap .
growth and solidarity those be two key word that must guide we european economic strategy .
growth , because , without it , we will be unable to take up social challenge .
solidarity , because it be raison d ?tre european integration and will be its future .
this right be enshrine in treaty , include treaty lisbon .
i vote for 2009 annual statement on euro area and public finances .
furthermore , we must pay particular attention to problem associate with fiscal discipline .
at same time , member state and european commission must work together to reduce fiscal imbalance .
irish labor party do not support introduction ccctb .
i abstain from vote on this particular report .
specific problem be not one ofsoundfinance .
need for stricter regulation and supervision financial crisis be as urgent as ever .
ccctb be not about common tax rate .
taxation company be exclusive responsibility each member state .
i do not support paragraph 29 as it call for introduction ccctb .
clearly , this europe be yet another enemy people .
we must learn lesson from mistake make so that they can be avoid in future .
as predict by economist , 2009 be most difficult for crisis hit member state .
cost fight crisis have lead to drastic worsen situation public finances .
for euro area , financial crisis have prove to be greatest challenge in its history .
crisis have ruthlessly lay bare weakness common currency system .
we only need to carry out that process rationally .
mr const?ncio have impressive cv .
we will continue to fight these policy , regardless who be involve in they management .

if appoint to this office , she promise to carry out she work accord to two principle .
i be convince that auditor have prove she competence and professionalism in area auditing .

objection by anyone who do not wish to see appointment in question take place be understandable .
that be case , my abstention be justified .
vote in favor mr fazaka be disappointing .
it set serious precedent .
this be no ordinary vote .
mr fazaka be suspect be ex collaborator communist secret service .
hungarian press produce document regard this .
number opinion be hear that oppose anypunishmentagainst mr fazaka .
they ask for past not to be revive .
this be wrong .
past be not dead .
ten million eastern european still live life trouble by communist horror .
this would be recipe for politics diminish responsibility .
public office would lose dignity .
anyone , however corrupt or immoral , could stand for public office .
perpetrator communist indignity should not be part democratic order they try to suppress .
mr fazaka hide he past and lie when ask about it .
this lack honesty should not be reward .
he be currently undersecretary state at ministry regional development .
mr kubik perform very well during european parliament hearing , and he candidature have not raise any doubt .
in view this , i decide to endorse he candidacy .
it operate with complete independence .
i fully endorse these recommendation .
eu and its member state be significant contributor to un poss budget .
i believe that eu seat in enlarged security council should remain goal european union .
ambition to gain eu seat within enlarged security council have to be pursue .
member state should make every effort to have this matter include in assembly poss agenda .
there be many issue interest at global level .
any attempt to reduce , weaken or postpone promise make must be fight .
it be therefore important to attempt to reach agreement between develop and develop country on speed up progress .
in addition , another crucial question be assistance in maintain order and in rebuild disaster hit country .
i find it impossible to vote for this text , although i do admit that it have certain quality .
it be true that it promote non proliferation nuclear weapon and control all weapon .
it be true that it promote abolition capital punishment .
reform development cooperation system , which be cover in report , must also be support .
this need to be tackle urgently as current development aid policy can be see to have fail .
development aid must be review , reorganise and restructure together with develop country .
for this reason , i abstain during final vote .
furthermore , report consistently link civil and military instrument , which be something that i can not support .
only once we have find common european approach on european roma issue will strategy be actively implement .
in romania , accord to some estimate , roma minority amount to more than 2 million .
this be larger than hungarian minority and , some would logically say , stronger .
this fact may also be reason that all national social inclusion program have completely fail .
education be key to integration process .
by offer education and training , we be fight exclusion , unemployment and discrimination .
we be also guarantee society that be more fair , more creative and more dynamic .
protect fundamental rights and create common area freedom , security and justice be objective european integration .
it be important to adopt common position on structural and pre accession funding policy .
member this ethnic minority continue to suffer discrimination and social exclusion , despite effort to integrate they .
eu have be support member state in they effort to implement effective policy .
cordoba . be discussion result in april at second european roma summit in c ?
it will fall to sociologist and historian to assess cause and consequence issue surround roma .
