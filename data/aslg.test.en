and why is that ?
because it has many faults .
as well as that , the directive does not mention scheduled flights .
that concludes this item .
thank you all for your understanding and for the disciplined proceedings .
the next item is the joint debate on 
the treaty of lisbon gives parliament additional powers in the area of the budget .
this , of course , poses a particular challenge that of discipline .
there will not be a repeat a second chance .
we have to establish very many things at the conciliation meeting .
why else is 2011 so special ?
as you know , the multiannual financial framework covers the years 2007 20we have already learned a great deal during the four previous budget procedures .
however we say it , we are in a situation where the multiannual financial framework is becoming exhausted .
the margins are very small .
the treaty of lisbon gives new powers to the european union in areas such as space policy .
what is significant is that it also establishes the european external action service .
reflection on the budget is also essential , and on how we intend to realise the eu 2020 strategy .
none of these undertakings was provided for in the multiannual financial framework .
young people are already the driving force and future of europe .
i would like to mention some statistics 21 people between the ages of 15 to 24 are unemployed .
i will now switch to english because I am now going to be replacing mrs helga trüpel .
i have prepared to speak in english which accounts for the change of language .
therefore , the committee emphasises legislative excellence , which is a top priority .
member of the commission . mr president , I am in a listening mood this evening .
the first is that we are adjusting to the post lisbon treaty environment .
we have partly adjusted , but some work remains to be done .
good cooperation between the institutions is needed more than ever , because of a single reading in parliament .
what has been already agreed are some transitional period arrangements agreed at the november conciliation .
a pragmatic timetable permitting predictability in the budget has been in place since 1975 and has also been confirmed .
what remains are the modalities in the conciliation committee .
this is essential now , given there is a single reading of the annual budget .
here I am referring to heading 1a and heading in other words , the report on priorities is clearly upgrading heading what is important is implementation . that should be at cruising speed by 20therefore , I am looking forward now to starting the procedure for 20brussels , too , must watch how it spends every public euro .
sustainable growth in poor countries will afford people opportunities they do not currently have .
not only that , but their development forms part of the solution to our crisis .
developing countries are a market , and a fast growing one at that .
we must protect the development cooperation budget , however hard that may be .
after all , choices relating to poverty reduction must never be dependent on our diplomatic interests .
i welcome the fact that we can deem the 2011 budget theyouthbudget .
we believe and recommend that parliament should abandon a budgetary model that is purely incremental .
instead , it should move towards a zero based budget , which makes efficiency , and therefore savings , possible .
we still need to find out more and more thoroughly about what our fixed expenditure is .
this must still be followed by a cost benefit analysis of the various policies implemented .
for our part , this dialogue must be honest . we are committed to seeing that it is .
however , these guidelines are also a very realistic first step .
this is particularly sensitive with regard to the first heading , the heading on competitiveness , growth and employment .
on behalf of the alde group . mr president , I would like to stress three points .
firstly , concerning the structural funds approximately 35 % of the budget .
we are doing only half as well as we did in 2000 200the current absorption rate in all funds is 14 % and it was 25 % before .
otherwise , we will have a situation where the money is not used .
on the other hand , it could be a reserve .
there is also the question of whether this money will be used or not .
in the agriculture budget in 2009 , payments were eur 2 billion less for rural development than in 200lastly , regarding the seventh framework programme .
so the question is whether delivery will be satisfactory .
then we can plan the budget according to the situation .
we have so many needs in other areas as well .
so are those reserves or not ?
indeed , those priorities leave much to be desired .
in itself , this choice of priority is something to be welcomed .
one proposal , for example , is the creation of an erasmus first job programme .
the problem is that in politics , the devil is in the detail .
what are we talking about when we talk about anerasmus first job?
how are we to implement it ?
by diverting erasmus funds to students , or by creating a new programme with fresh money ?
i believe that these questions go to the very heart of the debate .
the most pertinent issue in 2011 will still be the unemployment that is rampant in the eu .
it is our responsibility to tackle unemployment .
many of them are fairly well educated .
they only lack job opportunities .
i , frankly , would not be able to respond if they asked this question .
no proposal for an increase in the budget should be tolerated .
i would like to concentrate on two aspects .
investment in youth means thinking today about the europe of tomorrow .
hu fellow members , we all know that the european union's budget needs serious reforms .
what is our problem ? our big problem is that this is an extremely inflexible budget .
we cannot rise adequately to the daily challenges , or even to the annual challenges except with difficulty .
the conclusion was that the eu sanctions that were disguised as bilateral measures had no valid legal basis .
they were an unwarranted encroachment on austrian sovereignty .
mr nérin's death reminds us of our duty to cooperate in the fight against terrorism .
very early on , franco spanish cooperation proved to be a model of its kind within the european union .
france and spain were the first member states to introduce joint investigation teams within the european judicial area .
implementing european arrest warrants also proved very effective .
we shall therefore have to increase our cooperation if we are to combat terrorism more effectively .
theno tavcampaign has clearly shown that there is no justification for tav .
only 38 % of current rail capacity is used .
only big business and major construction interests stand to gain .
i call on the eu to withdraw all funding for tav and for the cancellation of tav .
theno tavcampaign's motto issarà dura.
they will not flinch .
take the small town of congleton , for example , which is a local semi rural community .
you see , this is the genius of the eu it is always one person removed .
the green belt has successfully protected the beauty of our countryside and blocked arbitrary urban sprawl .
this shows a lack of respect for our culture and traditions , but what do you care ?
i wish to emphasise the need for action to prevent psychological violence as well against women .
recent studies have shown that this kind of violence always precedes acts of physical violence .
i would like to stress that it is impossible to curb rising poverty in a year .
we are fighting with all the workers to create .
once studies of this nature get into the mass media , they naturally raise concerns among consumers .
against this backdrop , we must ask ourselves two questions .
hu the new member states are now implementing the 2007 european union wine market organisation .
this is contrary to eu regulations because this wine can belong to either one category or the other .
the slovak request is now no longer in the community's e bacchus database among the protected designations of origin .
the commission has thus put an end to this illegal situation , and I thank them for it .
for this reason , I ask the commission to remedy this irregular situation .
meanwhile , how is the corps of the european external action service being created ?
the rapporteur has produced a balanced proposal .
she has taken into account the realities of the situation and formulated sound targets .
i hope that parliament will follow and support the text and proposal before us .
i would like to speak for a few more minutes about the cohesion policy .
the cohesion policy is not a form of do goodism .
true , there are enormous gaps between the developed and the underdeveloped regions .
we seek to eliminate these differences , or at least to shrink them .
otherwise , there is no greater waste .
i hope that there will be progress in this regard .
the committee on budgets is very keen to see that we get value for our money .
thank you for your respectful attention .
the initial report was perhaps understandably vague and general .
however , the amendments at committee stage ensured we are now clear on what is important .
i am sure all members will take that point on board .
the analysis of europarl tv , to see if it is effective or not , is also welcome .
it should not be a unilateral decision .
i hope tomorrow , colleagues will support these and other amendments which are aimed at improving the guidelines .
the guidelines for the 2011 budget also include the european parliament's own budget .
nl mr president , we are living in financially and economically difficult times .
in addition , citizens have little confidence in european policy , and this concerns me greatly .
i wish to present two proposals relating to the examination of the next budget , therefore .
this is not the case at present , which is not what I would call transparent .
mr president , my second point concerns the budgets of the national information offices of the european parliament .
i call on my fellow members to support these proposals .
this would demonstrate our desire for transparency and our intention not to give ourselves special treatment .
i have a substantive question regarding the priority the rapporteur gives to youth .
as a rule , social and youth affairs can be handled very well by member states .
yet I would draw attention to one issue where eu support is truly indispensable .
the report mentions young people's transition from education to the labour market .
last month , on a visit to bulgaria , I saw a truly inspiring example of this .
i am counting on you .
mr president , the most important priority of any budget should be only to spend your own money .
spending someone else's without their permission is not budgeting , it is theft .
taking that money , without a democratic mandate , is not a victimless crime .
our soldiers are killed by taliban bombs because we cannot afford blast proof vehicles .
thousands of cancer victims are denied expensive life saving drugs .
there should be only one budget priority slash spending and stop robbing britain .
to them , it is a matter of life or death .
we in parliament are not going to put pressure on him for the time being .
as he knows , we will be doing that from september onwards .
new challenges for the 2011 budget arise every day .
i would like to comment briefly on both reports .
firstly , I would like to thank mrs jędrzejewska , who has produced an excellent report .
firstly , we need to make it clear that climate change is still a major priority .
in all other respects , however , we need to look for ways to make savings and increase efficiency .
this is particularly relevant , as heading 5 of the budget , for administration , is severely stretched .
we recently discussed the new external action service , for example , which will certainly require extra resources .
we must focus on parliament's core task and elsewhere employ a great deal of constraint .
parliament should be taking a lead .
we need to send a clear message to our governments on this and save 200 million a year .
the european external action service is something that I take a particular interest in .
however , this is not yet included in the budget that the commissioner is soon to present .
however , the question of how much it will cost is of key importance for us .
i am in favour of us including this service within the commission , as that is where it belongs .
we cannot have administration of multiannual programmes outside the commission .
we cannot allow this under any circumstances .
for that reason , what is most interesting about this budget is what it does not include .
everything is accounted for , down to the last cent .
this rail journey basis should be scrapped , with the focus put on airline tickets and flying time instead .
i would therefore like to ask specifically that we provide ourselves with appropriate means to enable us to work .
the bureau should be so kind as not to trouble the members on this account .
i have one further request .
de mr president , we need a different eu and we also need a different eu budget .
i think we need the courage to make big decisions .
we should certainly not get bogged down in minute technical details .
i would like to say three things about the eu budget .
the current eu budget does not provide any realistic information on this .
my second point is about savings .
for example , we could shut down a large number of the eu's agencies .
then there is the second seat in strasbourg .
thirdly , how is the money used ?
the money should be given , or given back , to where it comes from , namely the taxpayers .
i think we need courage .
we would all do well to take note of this .
the time has come for decisions about spending money from eu coffers to be made jointly .
however , time is also needed for this mechanism to begin to work .
europe is still behind in the technology race with the usa , japan and other new world powers .
however , this can , certainly , be changed , but it requires significant outlays .
investing in young people is investing in the future .
young people with degrees are increasingly affected by unemployment .
commitment to young people , innovation and science is the key to making europe a world leader once again .
the support for small and medium sized enterprises , mainly in the weakest regions , is also interesting .
our priority must be to preserve existing jobs and create new ones .
i believe that the european union must invest in an intelligent and ambitious industrial policy .
a medium and long term successful buildings strategy is important .
it needs to be environmentally friendly , energy efficient and particularly cost effective .
even municipal politicians like the mayor , freddy thielemans , admit this .
young people must be supported both at eu and national level .
however , it is also vitally important to increase the funding for erasmus mundus grants .
job retention and creation should receive most attention .
yes , that was low level in 2009 20it should go at cruising speed by 2011 , as should anti crisis delivery .
but , of course , this should come this year if the external action service is to be operational .
let us hope also for a fruitful conciliation of the 2011 figures .
i am very pleased and motivated by this .
as you know , the year 2011 is the fifth year of the multiannual financial framework .
surely it is time we learned something from those four years . the fifth ought to be decidedly better .
many of you said something which I agree with that young people are the european union's future .
they are in education today and they are looking for work today .
young people are not only our future , they are our today .
we should keep reminding ourselves of this .
i would also like to say a few words on this extended thinking about the european union budget .
i would also like to say a few words to summarise the debate on the european parliament budget .
once again , I would like to thank you for your attention .
written statements rule 149 
this project will only have a chance of success if we provide the necessary funding for it .
this includes technological innovation , sustainable development , combating climate change and care for biodiversity .
support for the development of educational systems , with the assistance of interdisciplinary investment , is also strongly justified .
the money must be invested in enterprises which guarantee that graduates will find employment .
testing will also start in 2014 on the safety of life service and commercial service .
let me remind you that galileo is crucial to the future of high tech industry in europe .
it will create new markets and enable europe to become a global competitor in the field of technology .
the circumstances in which the 2010 and 2011 budgets will be adopted are exceptional and pose a particular challenge .
parliament must engage in an open discussion about the expenditure ceiling in heading 5 for 20work on the 2011 budget is under way .
the budgetary priorities must contain the european union's response to the challenges of the global crisis .
the europe 2020 strategy is , from this point of view , a very important factor .
request for the defence of parliamentary immunity see minutes
agricultural product quality policy what strategy to follow ? debate 
by supporting niche agriculture in these disadvantaged areas , we will create an economy and jobs there .
this last point is vitally important if we want to protect against the counterfeiting of our high quality products .
that is my intention , in any case .
it has been a real pleasure working with him and with the other spokespeople for the parliamentary groups .
i am delighted at what mr cioloş had to say .
we naturally hope he will listen to parliament's voice , which will be reflected tomorrow in the vote .
as you have all observed , competition can take many forms on the markets .
before concluding , I shall take the liberty of making one final point , which concerns labelling .
the report had four , or rather five points for debate .
first , the joint european union logo .
i therefore ask that we support the specific eu logo .
the second point is the question of the place of origin .
occasionally , this causes concern , most recently in the case of tokaj wine .
the fourth element the organic logo .
on this there is complete agreement .
i would like to return to the original form of mr scottà's report .
there is much in it that is to be commended .
we cannot support paragraph 19 , the so calledwonky fruitparagraph .
it is surely a decision for consumers .
i would also like to see some changes in paragraph it has to resonate with consumers and give some sort of return to the farming community .
otherwise , it is worthless .
we have brought forward a number of points and I will focus on two of them only .
i and others believe that our consumers want to know where their food comes from .
so there is much in this report to like .
i would echo mr lyon's comments on the eu logo .
i think that is more to do with the ambitions of this building rather than what our consumers want .
the amendments are constructive I hope they will be successful and that colleagues will support them tomorrow .
we must always strive to achieve the maximum potential of europe's agri food industry .
this will ultimately serve to increase our competitiveness and strengthen the economy in rural areas .
these instruments have proven popular with consumers and producers alike .
however , I agree with the rapporteur that their management and application must be simplified .
also , if we are serious about their value abroad , we must ensure more protection from third countries .
however , I must point out that there are some elements of this report which I do not support .
i am against the introduction of an eu quality logo .
what I support is country of origin labelling .
the fact is these rules were dismantled by the commission last year .
i wholeheartedly supported this move and now we can let the market set its own standards .
madam president , thank you for the opportunity to speak on this very important point .
obviously , promotion and marketing will be the hallmark of the success or failure of such a policy .
we must take firm action against the potential counterfeiting of products which are wrongly labelled .
i like many colleagues in this chamber would be against an eu logo .
i feel it would be largely meaningless and would not be helpful to consumers .
i come from northern ireland , a net exporter of agricultural products .
therefore , I want any labelling system to create a level playing field .
i therefore consider mandatory quality labelling to be an important opportunity for our farmers .
in order to guarantee this high quality standard , controls and objective criteria are certainly needed .
however , the fact is that financial considerations on the part of the consumer also have an effect .
quality costs , and farmers need a fair income .
we also need to raise the general awareness of consumers in this regard .
we need the introduction of a regulated and protected designation for products from mountain areas and from gmo free areas .
however , we also need thetraditional speciality guaranteedandorganic farmingindications .
whatever happens , these must be retained .
our businesses need to gain market recognition of the distinctive and quality related aspects associated with their products .
madam president , first , may I declare an interest ?
i am an egg producer .
regulations must be honestly implemented to a common standard .
that is essential .
an eu inspired crisis will shortly hit the uk egg industry .
only then can consumers make an informed choice .
i believe that we take the same approach to these quality products .
yes , they represent an opportunity for our most fragile regions .
management of production rights is a fundamental part of quality production policy .
moreover , almost all of our committee voted in favour of an amendment along these lines .
let us together interpret this amendment as a call to find a new middle way .
now present us with a good text .
do so quickly we have faith in you .
where a product comes from is important .
local specialities are of immeasurable value .
the region that I come from in finland produces a delicious goat's milk cheese .
i can recommend it to you all .
there are special products like this all over europe .
we have to ensure that they find their way onto the market .
we are pleased to note the fact that the importance of stimulating market demand has been emphasised .
a large number of smes , subcontractors and suppliers are affected by the financial crisis .
social europe assigns the same level of importance to economic development and social development .
from 2012 we will have a schengen airspace .
the operation of fabs is the main element in creating a single european sky .
the first of these is the functional airspace block system coordinator .
the european parliament also managed to have special attention focused on the human factor .
the new specifications issued by easa must integrate with the existing ones .
in addition , the opportunity has been given to mention the derogations granted so far .
for this reason I should like to thank parliament for the speed with which it has adopted this decision .
this has certainly been a major commitment and one that , I repeat , constitutes an effective response .
to conclude , for the first time every aspect of the entire aviation sector will be dealt with .
this is therefore the start of a new phase for the aviation safety agency .
she wanted a real single sky for the benefit of european citizens .
today we have been able to realise this reform .
the main contributions of the committee on industry relate to financing .
this second package of legislation will allow us to manage our airspace more efficiently in the years to come .
this organisation must be provided with the staff and equipment it needs in good time .
this is simply not true .
the european sky consists of a patchwork of 60 national control centres .
this is twice as many as in the usa , but with half the amount of air traffic .
in addition , military no fly zones prevent planes from flying in a straight line from one airport to another .
when the amount of traffic doubles , the safety risk increases fourfold .
this led us in 2004 to initiate the single european sky concept .
this makes a contribution to safety , to climate protection and to reducing the costs of air traffic .
together with the harmonisation of safety standards , this also constitutes a very beneficial step forward .
on behalf of the uen group . lv thank you , madam president .						
i believe that we can now make significant progress in this area .
the council has opposed this right until the end .
now even the sky is not the limit .
this is all about eu flag waving .
it is not to satisfy the public and has nothing to do with demand .
let us resurrect efficiency by allowing the supply to feed the demand and allowing innovation .
this is not the business of the eu .
please vote against .
to conclude , I also welcome the objective of optimising airport management .
i would like to thank mr marinescu for his excellent report and the commission for its initiative .
however , we should not only be concerned about improving functionality here and now in the current crisis .
we should also continue to focus on important issues from the past .
these include passenger rights .
the airlines have blatantly exploited this in the current situation the crisis , plus bad winter weather conditions .
their behaviour has been shameless .
my next point concerns liquids .
it does not make anyone safer .
it provides a few people with employment in the security checks at airports .
we are waiting impatiently for the regulation to be abolished .
de madam president , it is not simply the case nowadays that aircraft fly across national borders .
it is essential that flights in europe should be better coordinated .
in addition , co2 emissions are much too high and the airlines are subject to enormous costs .
all this will be changed and improved by the regulation which we will adopt tomorrow .
i think we have worked together to achieve something very positive for the people of europe .
that is what we are here for .
i agree , and that is the purpose of our work .
there are , however , a few areas where I would seek a little bit of clarification .
that could be a future stumbling block which I hope could be cleared up .
the data supplied today by iata are worrying .
its profits are set to drop by 12 % .
thus faced with a crisis of this kind , we are however capable of introducing cost cutting standards .
we have raised the problem during several meetings with the competent transport ministers .
i do not see significant progress being made by russia , but we shall persevere .
since there was no possibility of including it , it was not included in the legislative text .
faced with this data I have launched an inquiry by the directorate general for energy and transport .
the definition to which he refers has been somewhat superseded by the criteria listed .
to conclude , I am grateful to you once again .
the lack of rules and existence of weak rules has given rise to the financial and economic crisis .
i thank you once again for your great commitment .
i am pleased to be able to take part in and share this important political moment with you .
rapporteur . ro just some brief replies .
on the subject of eurocontrol , the reform process has started so that new responsibilities can be received .
i would also like to thank you for the positive feedback you have given on my efforts .
commissioner , I would like to congratulate you on this success .
i would like to thank the commission's team of experts which worked alongside us to produce this agreement .
i also thank the french presidency and czech presidency for their efforts , especially thierry boutsen and vera zazvorkova .
the vote will take place tomorrow wednesday , 25 march 2009 .
in writing . when creating aviation policy , safety must always be our primary concern .
i commend the aims of this report to make aviation safer and more efficient for all involved .
the development of a unified regulatory framework and the implementation of new technology will be expensive .
regional airports may find it very hard to sustain the added costs of updating their systems .
shannon airport in the west of ireland provides air traffic control for a large area of the north atlantic .
in the present economic environment it will not be easy to borrow for new equipment and training .
to pass these costs on to the consumer may be a case of diminishing returns .

interoperability of mobile chargers debate 
the technical reason for this difference there is none .
there is no technical reason .
this is a great opportunity concerning a technical matter , but an important one for european consumers .
nowadays , anyone who changes their mobile phone generally needs a completely different charger .
even different models from the same manufacturer do not use a standardised charger .
this is not a new issue .
mobile phones could overheat or even explode during the charging process .
therefore , I have taken specific steps to encourage the industry to bring a standard charger onto the market .
i am confident that the industry will act quickly .
however , in our role as a european institution we must stay on the ball .
we should under no circumstances exclude the possibility of introducing legal regulations .
this is good , but it does not go far enough .
the commission will not hesitate to make a legislative proposal if the industry does not introduce a voluntary agreement .
if that should not be the case , then legal intervention may also be required here .
this is a good thing in an economic crisis .
in addition , we should ask the standards institutes to produce proposals which will make this possible .
of course , this is not as easy as it seems .
on the one hand , we have the connection between the charger and the mobile phone .
it will be straightforward to establish a technical standard for this .
perhaps we could involve the international organisation for standardisation iso in order to find a worldwide solution .
i think that we need above all a common technical standard .
2012 is not far away .
even if the sets are different makes and models , they can be charged simultaneously .
progress is being made .
in the seventh framework programme for research we have large sums of money allocated .
that said , consumers must also have choices .
at the moment , consumers buying a new phone have no choice at all .
i therefore think that this is an excellent solution .
if a family goes away for a weekend , it might take 30 chargers with it .
you then need to find a specific charger of a specific make and model .
my compliments , again , commissioner .
you have to keep the big stick in reserve , but preferably reach a solution through coaxing and self regulation .
you have succeeded in that , and you have my congratulations .
de madam president , I have a further question for commissioner verheugen .
usb 2 ports can transfer not only energy but also data .
would this not be an alternative solution ?
all my experts tell me that the existing standard can be used for all hand held devices .
this is also my answer to mrs ţicău .
the standard you are asking about is in fact already in existence .
my final remark is directed once again at mr rübig .
i think this is a subject which could be taken much further .
the commission is already working on it and will report back to you on the results .
common consular instructions biometric identifiers and visa applications debate 
i have been negotiating with the council for quite a long time .
the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs adopted my report in november 200on fingerprinting the commission proposed to start fingerprinting children at six years old .
i think that is very important .
overall we have a reasonable deal .
the newly created rules require eu embassies and representations to take fingerprints and photos of applicants in future .
this meets four objectives .
secondly , it will prevent so called visa shopping .
thirdly , the process of applying for a visa will be speeded up .
unfortunately there was not a majority in favour of this in the house .
the latter will certainly benefit the european public and will enable us to improve our relations with third countries .
she is one of the few rapporteurs for whom nothing is impossible .
you know that my group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics .
nevertheless , the decision has been already adopted .
now , for us , it is crucial to obtain as many safeguards as possible .
here baroness ludford has done an excellent job .
however , we have many concerns .
we also oppose the charging of an additional service fee .
however , this does not prejudice our position on the lax report on the visa code .
the political discussion about whether babiesand small children's fingerprints are really needed is not yet over .
the regulations on outsourcing also cause me some concern .
strict , standardised regulations are certainly needed , as some member states are already using external service providers .
i do not believe that the compromise agreed with the council in this respect is adequate .
unfortunately , the council has ignored these concerns .
a further problem is the service charge involved in outsourcing .
i believe it is wrong to pass this charge on to the applicants .
however , in my opinion , the higher charges would immediately cancel out this benefit .
i would like to thank everyone for their work on this dossier over recent years .
since 1997 , about 6 million migrants have entered the uk .
about 4 million have left , leaving a net population increase of over 2 million .
this is equivalent to a new city the size of birmingham .
most of these migrants enter legally , because they are eu citizens .
in addition to that , we probably have one million illegal immigrants .
what we need is to leave the european union and regain control of our borders .
there are many member states in the eu whose citizens should not be allowed into britain without a visa .
what we do not need is a system devised by the european union .
however , it might have some unintended consequences .
look at another example of eu legislation championed by the liberal democrats .
any corrupt legal system may now demand the surrender of a british citizen , and we have to comply .
we have surrendered the right to protect our own citizens .
soon we will have trials in absentia and the common recognition of fines and confiscation orders .
all this was voted for and welcomed by the liberal democrats .
now the liberal democrat fanatics want us to embrace a common system for the application of visas .
firstly , I disagree with the use of external service providers .
secondly , there should have been better data protection .
diplomatic protection is vital to ensure effective protection of the personal rights of individuals .
are we already forgetting the swift case , involving the transmission of data gathered by the us authorities ?
thirdly , the cost of visas will rise and will vary from country to country .
the commission proposal aimed to prevent visa shopping .
we will therefore be encouraging exactly what we wanted to combat , namely visa shopping .
this will particularly apply in the case of families with several members .
as a result of all this , madam president , I cannot accept this compromise .
the introduction of fingerprints and photographs will ensure that the new visas cannot be forged or misused .
we will guarantee that they will be followed , because the necessary precautions have been taken .
in my country we have had very positive experiences in this respect .
for this reason , I am supporting this more citizen friendly approach .
up to this point I also support the rapporteur and I would like to congratulate her .
in the course of our work together , this has not always been the case , baroness ludford .
i regret this .
i think that observing the protection of personal data in particular is important for this regulation .
in practical terms , this data must be stored and processed in accordance with the specific european legislation .
at the same time , it also guarantees sufficient opportunities for protecting travellerspersonal data and human integrity .
it will also result in an overall improvement in the eu's image .
i shall convey to my colleague mr barrot all that they have said today .
they have been excellent .
i respect the positions of ms kaufmann and ms ždanoka .
i am very sad that mr coelho is not able to support this compromise .
after all they were in my original report .
mr batten has left the chamber .
i think that was part of the ukip election campaign .
i think mr batten , as usual , was somewhat muddled in his thinking .
i thank all the other speakers who made constructive contributions .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
furthermore , we need to focus particular attention on protecting the biometric data of those who have supplied it .
this regulation offers the possibility of cooperation with an external service provider for collecting visa applications .
novel foods debate 
i must also mention the cooperation with the czech presidency .
i was also surprised that the commission proposal took the internal market as its starting point .
i will begin with that point .
innovation is , of course , tremendously important .
that brings me on to my second point , namely what arenovel foods, actually ?
that was never really made clear in the commission proposal .
let me deal with nanotechnology first .
i had absolutely no idea what it was .
it therefore needs to come within the scope of the regulation .
this is not really a safety issue .
i fully agree that it is essential to uphold the precautionary principle .
however , I do not consider the draft report to be very satisfactory .
we also believe that any regulation should be proportionate and practical .
that may sound reasonable , but who is to establish such a fact and based upon what evidence ?
would not some existing products also be banned under such an edict ?
we agree with the need for the commission to present a legislative proposal on cloning .
we also agree with the need to strengthen data protection for a certain period .
it relates to questions regarding nanoparticles and nanomaterial .
this is an extremely important issue and its importance is growing .
we will also support some of the amendments .
we hope that we can still reach an agreement with the commission fairly soon .
for example , we cannot demand that a novel food has no negative impact on the environment .
reintroducing the application under the revised regulation would only mean further delays and costs for the industry .
we must be consistent in the political message we send to the commission and to citizens .
therefore , the novel food regulation is not an appropriate framework for such a complex issue .
we will also support labelling of nano ingredients .
people have the right to know what they eat and make their choices accordingly .
if some people are concerned about nanotechnology , then they should be able to make a different choice .
the procedures must protect consumers from the danger of unhealthy food and from being misled .
we need a definition of nanomaterials and clear labelling .
in the case of gene technology , we must close the labelling loophole as quickly as possible .
foods which come from animals that have been fed gmo feedstuffs must be labelled .
we have traceability on paper , so it will be possible .
we will see tomorrow how the members from germany have voted , because there is a labelling loophole here .
we do not want to take away the consumersright to choose for themselves .
they should have freedom of choice and the opportunity to make their own decisions .
we should make this very clear in this regulation .
my final point is that animals should not be subjected to unnecessary suffering .
for this reason , we are calling for a ban on duplicating animal testing .								
the commission has submitted a good proposal for updating the regulation on novel foods .
we have already heard about all of this .
anything which involves gmo legislation should not be included in the regulation on novel foods .
who are you aiming to pillory for this ?
my group has always supported the right of the consumer to know what foods contain .
why should there not be a reference to nanosubstances in the list of ingredients ?
therefore I recommend that my group votes in favour of the amendments .
however , it has now become clear how beneficial this postponement was for them .
a brief remark on cloning .
it is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it .
to avoid misunderstanding , this report does not address genetically modified foods .
europe would suffer a serious competitive disadvantage if it were left out of developments in this area .
the key is the scientific , comprehensive testing that accompanies the licensing process , guaranteed by the proposed regulation .
a major consideration is the strict regulatory system of labelling .
we must not allow the foods in question to be open to misleading consumers .
there is also a significant debate concerning cloned animals .
it would be more appropriate to regulate cloning in a separate regulation .
we need to make this absolutely clear to consumers .
yet the development of animal cloning as a method of food production is being pursued without public awareness .
after all , cloning causes great distress to animals .
i also regard amendment 60 as important .
why do we respond as if we are scientific illiterates on any new aspect of this area ?
have none of us , or very few of us , scientific backgrounds in this parliament at all ?
the same question can be asked of national parliaments .
we must base legislation on thorough , serious science and accept that .
if not , our credibility as legislators is in question .
there were some critical comments too , of course .
that , too , I am happy with , as it can only be good for the debate .
through our input and our proposals , we will succeed in achieving this aim .
i would also like to thank the commissioner for what she said about animal cloning .
substances that deplete the ozone layer recast debate 
our atmosphere is formed in such a way that there are two different layers that protect us .
the co2 in the tropospheric layer holds in the warmth so that we do not get too cold .
thus , those substances that are being prohibited act both to deplete the ozone and to increase global warming .
it is already prohibited to produce hcfcs , and their use will be banned from 20this is an important policy basis .
sixty four amendments were adopted in the committee on the environment , public health and food safety .
there were then two trialogues , which resulted in an agreement between the council and parliament .
i would like to briefly mention nine important results of that agreement .
first of all , the legal basis for the regulation has been changed to the environment .
that allows the member states the possibility of adopting more far reaching measures to protect the environment .
secondly , the use of the pesticide methyl bromide will be prohibited as of 18 march 20this also applies to the gassing of containers to control vermin .
the only remaining exception will be for emergencies , such as where a large scale epidemic occurs .
fourthly , hcfcs may only be used in government designated businesses .
fifthly , some new substances have been added to the list of substances that are nominated for restrictive measures .
the european commission has undertaken to investigate these substances further .
it has also been agreed , in this regard , that there must be no increase in laboratory use .
the eighth point is that attention is being given to enforcement by means of inspections .
there is , however , more to be done in order to tackle the problem of stored ozone depleting substances .
the commission has an important job here .
all in all , we have achieved a satisfactory result .
apart from protecting the ozone layer , limiting these substances has extremely positive repercussions on the climate .
however , in order to make this possible , a number of persistent problems need to be overcome .
this will put community legislation on methyl bromide at the vanguard at global level .
the benefits , both in terms of restoring the ozone layer and reducing greenhouse gases , will be considerable .
the european commission is in a position to accept in full the compromise package of amendments .
the montreal protocol is considered to be one of the most successful of all international environmental agreements .
the montreal protocol itself has had additions made to it no less than four times .
the 20 year old treaty was amended in this way in london , copenhagen , montreal and beijing .
it is this same wisdom that we now need in the case of the kyoto protocol .
as is often the way with solutions to environmental problems , however , another aspect to the problem emerged .
some of them are more than a thousand times more intense as global warmers than carbon dioxide .
it thus became necessary to amend the weak points in the treaty .
it will not cut global emissions and will not even reduce carbon intensiveness .
climate change is an environmental problem on a totally different scale from earlier problems .
the world still runs on carbon .
that is why climate change must be seen above all as a problem of industrial engineering .
let us learn a lesson from montreal .
due to the quantity of methane released into the atmosphere , it should also be included in further work .
the uen supports this regulation .
i thank mr blokland for his labour intensive and relevant report .
many of these substances are powerful greenhouse gases , but they have nonetheless been excluded from the kyoto treaty .
that was because it was thought that they would be regulated under the montreal protocol .
i hope that this principle will be incorporated into legislation when the next steps are taken .
that is fine , mrs doyle , please do so .
these substances , we must remind ourselves , also have a global warming potential .
mrs doyle , you were as good as your word .
we still know little about this substance , and its production , for that matter .
in that way we will be obtaining precise information about this substance .
our mutual cooperation has been excellent , in committee and in the negotiations .
in every case , the result was satisfactory .
i have one more comment to make , in conclusion .
i am not very happy with the recasting system .
it is not easy to know on what basis you can or cannot make amendments .
recasting remains a difficult issue for the work of this parliament .
the key challenges are as follows 
our health is maintained through a clean environment and the atmosphere around us .
consequently , I totally agree with additional measures being taken to limit or even ban ozone depleting substances .
ladies and gentlemen , we have noted the internal political situation in the czech republic .
the spring council provides proof of that .
there was a relatively strong turn out .
the topic attracting the greatest attention was of course the question of how to resolve the current economic crisis .
i completely reject assertions that we are doing little in the way of more profound measures .
we agreed that all of the short term measures must be temporary and that is how we view them .
we should take a look at the history books , which have clearly been gathering dust .
the g20 summit will provide just one of the opportunities for us to talk about this .
if any of these were undercut , then we would emerge from this crisis in a weaker state .
there is no reason for pessimism ahead of the g20 discussions , as mr rasmussen fears .
the current crisis , as we all know , is a crisis of confidence .
the third key area for resolving the crisis is therefore the restoration of confidence .
it is not enough simply to pour money into the system .
the banks must start lending money but they will not if they do not have confidence .
the liquidity that is available to them has not solved the problem .
confidence can neither be decreed nor purchased .
we have agreed even on this .
markets are nervous , reacting immediately , excessively and negatively to every signal .
we therefore need better regulation .
i would emphasise thatbettermight mean the introduction of regulation where none has existed so far .
this is where you step in , ladies and gentlemen of the european parliament .
it is precisely here that most of the noise and criticism is centred in my view undeservedly .
the plan is allegedly deficient , slow and unambitious .
i would like to set the record straight .
the second major theme of the european council was the climate and energy question .
we made significant progress both in energy security and climate protection .
the gas crisis has not been resolved .
it is more than clear that we need this .
the climate debate discussions and preparations are already beginning for the copenhagen conference .
we are trying to find a joint position at the european level .
the decision we took was the right one .
i would like to pre empt questions about the participation of belarus .
we are considering this .
at this moment we are holding the door open to belarus but no decision has been taken .
the organisational details have still not been finalised but you will all be informed in detail .
there were many other issues at the european council about which I am ready to respond .
it proves that , even when times are tough , solidarity is not a hollow word in europe .
the debate that we held yesterday with the uk prime minister , gordon brown , clearly demonstrated this .
this is not a technocratic agenda .
people must be re installed at the heart of the global economy .
we are in favour of open and competitive economies , but economies in which the markets serve the citizens .
it points out that we are in favour of a social market economy .
however , the european council also looked beyond the crisis .
this investment is critical in these difficult times .
we all know that the credit crunch has had a direct impact on strategic projects .
there are some challenges , particularly the possibility of a freeze on oil and gas connections .
it has put the brakes on investment in renewable energy .
it has also put research on clean technology on hold .
therefore , we need to have a clear european response .
the same is true of the package of existing and forthcoming measures on the financial system .
i am very happy with that result .
we also need to continue to deepen the work of coordination .
coordination is key coordination and implementation .
we have some instruments .
we also have the instruments of the lisbon strategy that remain in force .
the same spirit should inspire us as we prepare for the employment summit .
unemployment is rising and most likely will go on rising .
this is my number one concern , and I think it should be the number one concern in europe .
workers all over europe must know that european leaders care .
as you will know , the european council decided that the summit should take place in a troika format .
to be open and frank with you as I always am I was disappointed with this decision .
i think we saw the willingness of the social partners to engage with us .
we have invited the social partners to come to the commission .
i am determined that we should have all the possible options on the table .
you have a wealth of knowledge about action on the ground .
we need to keep up the momentum of the process .
this is the meaning of european integration .
we need more jobs , and this package of measures will allow this .
climate change will not wait for the end of the crisis .
the 27 requested this last week we expect to have a road map in june .
it does you honour in your difficult circumstances .
in any case , you were toppled by two civil democratic party votes and two green votes .
so what about obstruction by your own people ?
you said that the path that the us is taking is historically the wrong path .
that is what you said here a few moments ago .
you said that geithner's way is the wrong way and leads to hell .
that is not the level at which the european union can work with the us .
that is the big mistake that you are making here .
no , mr president in office , that is the way to take the european union back up a blind alley .
the president of the commission said something very important today .
he said that it would be a serious mistake to deny the social summit , the employment summit .
we have no time for that .
that is a fatal signal .
that is the wrong signal .
we do not want a troika we want a discussion open to everyone .
secondly , please re convene the social summit .
show the european public that employment policy and initiatives to protect jobs are at the centre of government action .
i personally feel very sorry for you .
we are here to help you .
no problem , we are by your side and will do whatever we can .
we must still be able to demand a minimum of institutional respect .
so these three points , mr topolánek , and then you will regain some prestige with us .
all these are welcome .
investment in transport , infrastructure and broadband connections will create jobs now and prepare europe for the future .
meanwhile , money going to the nabucco pipeline will ease our troubling energy reliance on russia .
but for all the apparent agreement , a niggling nuance remains over member statespriorities .
this is a false choice .
the long term and the short term both must be addressed .
our leaders must be clear about that at the g20 summit .
if we cannot agree on our common cause then we cannot hope to punch at our collective weight .
america will come to the g20 with her own agenda .
we must arrive with ours and together reach a deal that delivers for all .
that moment has passed for your government .
for europe it is yet to come .
see to it that domestic difficulties do not sap your stride .
mr topolánek and his entire cabinet have proved that it is possible .
however , because we are among friends , we must speak sincerely .
i will start with support for the eastern partnership .
together this means barely eur 20 million annually for each country which is part of the project .
is that really sufficient for the eu to build its influence in the region ?
it seems to me that absolutely nothing has been decided .
in fact a decision has been made to refuse any kind of cooperation in this area .
we can see obstruction for the same reason when we consider construction of the nabucco gas pipeline .
at the summit eur 5 billion was also allocated to the anti crisis package .
therefore I propose extending the time frame of availability for these funds .
the participants of that summit unanimously opposed economic protectionism .
i appeal to mr topolánek to put an end to this .
this morning I would like a wake up call .
we are in a system crisis , and this system crisis can quickly develop into a societal crisis .
roosevelt in the 1930s won the political battle against the fascists europe lost it .
so , why did roosevelt win ?
what are the four elements of trust which roosevelt won ?
the first was reregulation .
roosevelt heavily attacked the oligopolies , the big companies in the us , and reregulated the economy .
even if gordon brown were the champion of deregulation , maybe this shows that change can happen .
secondly , strengthen the social fabric .
roosevelt's fourth issue was his economic investment .
we do not want to go to war .
the war we have to win today is the war against the planet .
our war is green investment that is where we have to win the war .
one is that we need green eurobonds .
second , we have to bring the cities of europe into the game .
that is winning the economy and it is winning the hearts of citizens for europe .
however , the problem is one of who can restore confidence and how it can be restored .
i would like to comment again on the eastern partnership .
we are therefore establishing a sphere of influence and thus doing something ourselves which we sharply criticise in others .
the conclusions of the summit in this regard are very vague .
throughout the crisis I have repeatedly questioned the commission about its desire to regulate and control the financial sector .
it has no desire to do so .
it continually refers to the right of the internal market to govern what happens .
he said that the economies of europe are too different for the euro .
bingo , mr delors !
that is precisely what they are .
the single currency is part of the problem , not part of the solution .
i also welcome the postponement of a decision over financing climate moves .
yesterday the government of the czech prime minister and eu council president mirek topolánek lost a vote of confidence .
following the collapse of the topolánek government president václav klaus has the strongest political mandate in the czech republic .
all concerns about the irresponsibility of the czech republic are therefore completely unnecessary .
that too is democracy .
that is point number one .
the system quite simply works .
in my opinion this is definitely not a minor task and it will cost a lot of money .
there is a great difference between proclaiming fine words on a street corner and putting them into practice .
i will not be responding to the comments of party leader mr schulz .
berlusconi did that before the last elections and I have no wish to repeat his mistake .
nevertheless , it is impossible that banknote printers will be the only ones to profit from this crisis .
that would not be a good thing .
the job summit .
we proposed a full format to the european council , of course .
it was not our decision that this summit would be a troika .
the lisbon treaty .
i will allow myself one joke today .
i have to say that responsibility for moving the situation forwards really lies with those who created the situation .
the commission .
we will of course consult with you it is essential to have discussions with the european parliament .
i think that 17 days would give us enough time for the debate .
further discussions related to questions about regulation versus stimulus measures .
in my opinion this is the only option for tackling the situation .
i have already mentioned the stimulus packages .
the second pillar of this structure is regulation , which lies partially in your hands .
it is also partially mentioned in the larosière report , which is a fine piece of work .
we are not under time pressure from day to day to come up with the new regulation .
we are under time pressure to limit any possible future problems .
it marks a significant step towards stabilising the situation .
i was recently in azerbaijan where I spoke with president aliyev .
the eu must remain a sort of lighthouse for these countries .
if the light is extinguished in this lighthouse , development in these countries will not be under our control .
in conclusion I would like to say something about social impacts .
here I must return to the tripartite and applaud the role of both social partners .
we did not talk about how much money we would give to people .
workforce mobility .
this is the barrier to a solution .
i would like to say in conclusion something about the eu us summit .
i would finally like to say something about the remarks of mrs bobošíková .
the czech administration is managing the situation very well so far .
thank you mr president in office of the european council .
he was so right to remind us all of the fundamental principle that underlines the eu .
he ignored his role in putting in place and operating a fundamentally flawed financial regulatory framework .
europe needs no lectures from the british government about what must be done to get out of this crisis .
the council here today is a council of silence and a council of illusions .
i am sorry , but I have not seen any concrete measures .
yes , eur 5 billion , but what is that ?
that is 0.04 % of this union's gross national product .
you have not understood that this crisis is a very deep , serious recession .
business is demanding , workers are demanding , we are demanding do more !
the imf has proposed that you invest 2 % of gdp this year and next year .
mr barroso , you said that we are doing well we are investing 3.3 % .
that was what you said two weeks ago , but now it has increased to 4 % .
i ask myself how is that ?
well , the calculation is simple .
unemployment is increasing when expenditure on unemployment benefits increases , the financial stimulus will increase .
please , we cannot do it in this way .
you cannot do it in this way . what we need is real investment .							   
what you must tell people is that you are committed to a new recovery plan .
we are on your side and will support you in getting that .
now it is proposed this summit on 7 may should be reduced to a troika .
this unemployment crisis will not disappear because we refuse to have more meetings .
it will still be there .
this is about the destiny of the european union's economic , monetary and social efforts .
if you can do that , we will be with you .
supervisory legislation must be amended and precautions for crisis management improved .
legislation governing the financial sector should have the effect of blunting rather than exacerbating economic cycles .
however , more regulation does not necessarily mean better regulation what we need is the right regulation .
we also have proof of how important the common market is to prosperity and stability in europe .
the internal market is playing a central role in shortening and dampening the recession in europe .
however , it is also clear that the test has not yet been passed .
the european union must hold fast to its principles .
the czech presidency stands for this and I hope that we can continue to count on that .
he says now that banking regulation must be tightened up , tax havens tackled and the imf reformed .
his own record of managing the uk economy is one of negligence and catastrophe .
he is an architect of the current economic crisis , not a saviour of the world .
he favoured the light touch regulation that is a direct cause of the problems in banking .
the impact of the downturn is , of course , being felt around the world .
he says that the path taken by the us has been historically discredited .
that surprises me .
this is where the corrections should apply .
that stands in pertinent contradiction to any form of fight against the causes of crises .
the agreement at the eu summit last week is not strong enough to instigate a new , sustainably oriented economy .
the european union must take a lead in that regard .
we had expected an agreement on the funding of the bali and poznań climate deals .
where is the eu's leadership when it comes to tangible funding ?
that is not the leadership that is needed in the run up to copenhagen .
cuts need to be made during the crisis .
there is sufficient margin for savings , for example in the uncontrolled growth of eu agencies .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congratulate the czech presidency .
when I listen to the chairman of the socialist group , I think I am on another planet .
how can someone who has obstructed that for a decade today be declared our saviour ?
i do not understand that .
living on credit is the problem .
i would like to say how typical and characteristic that is for this government .
these characteristics and this inability to cooperate are the real cause for the collapse of his government .
however , I do not want to focus on czech domestic politics .
ahead of us lie many tasks .
the economic and financial crisis has of course already been mentioned .
in conclusion I would like to comment once again on the lisbon treaty .
the czech social democrats have always supported the european constitution and have always supported ratification of the lisbon treaty .
what must we do to avoid these problems ?
firstly , countries must evaluate the effect of integration on their own national economic policy .
now decisions are often taken on the basis of past history , how we behaved in situations of crisis .
secondly , some sort of temporary institutional framework must be created for the decision implementation mechanism .
wait until the lisbon agreement is ratified ?
people's lives do not wait , we have to take decisions today .
it is obvious that there must be greater coordination between the countries in the eurozone and non eurozone countries .
how can this be achieved ?
this would help bring both europes , new europe and old europe , closer together and find a consensus .
pl mr president , during the recent european summit many subjects were raised .
one of these was the question of the eastern partnership and alternative routes of gas supply .
europe is facing a huge economic crisis and must look for effective ways out of it .
however , we must not depart from our guiding principle of solidarity .
we should be especially sensitive to the problems of new member states .
the domestic situation in the czech republic should not in any way interfere with this .
we need to dare to try something new if we are to make headway in this crisis .
my honourable friend was right we are living on credit .
however , we are also living on credit as far as the environment and climate are concerned .
we have endlessly squandered resources .
we are not managing the economy in a sustainable manner .
unfortunately , the european council is not currently mustering up that much courage .
unfortunately , I do not believe that the czech republic alone is to blame .
thank you , mrs harms .
we are all sinners some more than others .
this will require proactive interventions by member state governments .
free market theology must not stand in the way of doing right by workers .
the light touch regulation of the financial markets was always a road to rip off and corruption .
obsessive deregulation and privatisation of public services will equally end in tears .
so , is the common refrain that we must learn the lessons of this economic crisis genuine ?
the lisbon treaty is old hat .
it is a charter for the policies of failure .
we need a new treaty for a new time .
fr mr president , the presidency conclusions from the last council make for amusing reading .
they resemble a victory statement of routed armies everywhere .
that dogma is completely wrong .
we should return to our society's traditional economic vision of social justice and genuine production .
my congratulations on the results of the summit .
however , we are not dealing with any of that today .
your presidency , just like your government , represents the politics of double standards .
you have failed to integrate your own government .
the election of václav klaus as president also belongs to the politics of double standards .
this aim cannot be achieved without ratifying the lisbon treaty .
the treaty is now under serious threat and this is partly also your responsibility .
if you continue to govern in any form , you should make a clear stand for ratification .
my own party , the european democratic party , will do all it can for ratification .
the second serious omission is the euro .
you can participate in the g20 summit and represent europe at the summit .
it is important to have a european securities commission and to maintain the stability pact .
mr topolánek , the proposed measures are excellent .
at present they are only proposals .
as mrs merkel has said , what matters is implementation .
what is needed is the political will and unity which will make it possible to translate this into reality .
you were talking about a crisis of confidence .
that is what we have here .
it is increased unemployment and the wider gaps that it entails .
they must have been extremely disappointed with the results of the most recent summit .
absolutely no strategy for dealing with rising unemployment was established at that summit .
they say that they have already done what needs to be done .
the european parliament is not involved at all one month before the european parliament elections .
i would like to say something briefly about automatic stabilisers .
gm , the united states and sweden have been mentioned in the debate today .
thus , it is not quite so wonderful any more .
finally , I would like to say a few words about mobility .
mobility is important within the eu and so is the fight against protectionism .
then we can also work to promote increased mobility and to combat protectionism .
we could discuss that for many hours .
alongside that though , the issue of what we spend that money on is perhaps even more important .
we have definitely got things the wrong way round there .
another point is the solutions for eastern european countries and countries that are not in the single currency .
our economy was strong but has been weakened , just like economies all over the world at present .
as an old saying in ireland goes there is no strength without unity.
i , too , had expected a truer european dimension in the approach to the crisis .
that is what the european union is for .
solidarity with less developed countries must also form part of the european union's global approach .
i will conclude with a quick word about the treaty of lisbon .
we , parliament , must set out our position clearly .
we must know for certain what is going to happen straight after the european elections .
this sort of investment is furthermore especially suited to our times .
now we need real action .
unfortunately , the summit was unable to convince people of this .
this must also be the outcome of the meeting of the g20 countries .
when europe speaks with one voice , the united states of america will also then adopt this same objective .
sv mr president , the berlin wall fell almost 20 years ago .
this must not be allowed to happen !
it is worrying that renault is moving it production from slovenia to france .
we must not allow the spectre of protectionism to wreak havoc once again .
the cost of failing , once more , to keep europe together is far too high .
history will punish those who fail in their responsibility .
the same must also apply to president sarkozy .
there is every reason to welcome the proposal by the de larosière group .
the european central bank will have an even more important role .
the national supervisory authorities will also be given a better opportunity to coordinate themselves and exchange information .
policy must be appropriate even in times of crisis .
proposing regulations that hinder rather than help must not be our response in difficult times .
mr president , the council's declaration on the eastern partnership is most welcome .
this measure will help stabilise countries like hungary and latvia .
however , we must not forget ukraine either , which is suffering severe financial turmoil .
the members of euronest are sovereign states with the right to decide their own euro atlantic aspirations .
such language belongs to the machtpolitik cold war era , not to modern diplomacy .
mr president , my congratulations on your pronunciation of my rather difficult name !
the conservatives here and in member states are like naughty children .
that , my friends , is a recipe for fanning an uncontrollable forest fire .
president in office topolánek chose sweden as a comparison to america .
why not the czech republic ?
why not ireland ?
let us have an employment summit for all member states on 7 may .
why do I begin with these perhaps unpleasant remarks ?
we must welcome as an extremely positive result the agreement on energy projects and broadband internet .
not only has financial credit contracted but also social credit .
therefore , a social european union summit , leading towards a european pact on employment , is a must .
this global crisis is aggravated by a crisis of european integration .
there are member states hosting mother company economies and member states with economies of subsidiaries .
the former are members of the euro area , the latter are not .
programmes to facilitate the stabilisation and integration of the latter are crucial for the survival of the former .
the european union cannot survive with new demarcation lines .
i wish us all success in this matter .
pt the summit's response was not ambitious enough .
where is the firm commitment to abolish tax havens and offshore financial centres ?
where is the decision to moralise the salaries of banking executives ?
this is not the way to restore people's trust .
lastly , I heard someone say that they do not need socialist proposals .
that is an arrogant statement .
will they never learn ?
i fear that the crisis will continue for many years , which is not what we want .
implementation procedures can be too clumsy and time consuming .
it is especially important to accommodate framework conditions for small businesses and for innovation .
now it is really time to invest more in research , education and training .
as usual a crisis provides opportunities for reform .
and , most importantly , the crisis is no excuse for protectionism .
eur 5 billion for strategic energy projects and broadband internet .
eur 75 billion for the international monetary fund .
eur 600 million for the eastern partnership .
is this a lot or too little ?
is the glass half full or half empty ?
under normal circumstances , I would judge the results and agreements achieved by the european council as satisfactory .
undoubtedly we need to develop the energy infrastructure , but not at the expense of reducing consumption .
the european union continues to be committed to playing a leading role in the copenhagen global climate agreement .
mr president , I wish to begin by thanking the czech presidency for the successful summit .
i see three main priorities that we should focus on .
the first , of course , is jobs .
second , I am happy that we managed to eliminate partly , at least protectionist tendencies .
nevertheless , they are still alive , and I think solidarity is the key .
the third point the key is to restore confidence in the markets .
to be honest , I do not think it is helpful to pit these solutions against each other .
thus we need united action and a pro active approach , not the invisible hand .
with regard to fiscal stimuli , during the course of the morning we have had a considerable debate .
is it too little ?
is the united states doing more than us ?
with regard to the stability pact , I note certain contradictions in the commission's position .
my dear sir , we are against monetary inflation and we are also against speaking time inflation .
is it a match for what is at stake ?
this is not rhetoric , mr topolánek , this is a call for action .
if self satisfaction and fiction were instruments of economic recovery , then we might call it a success .
determined to do what ?
the agenda for this council has already been expurgated of any proposals that might have related to employment .
that was postponed until may .
what would be worrying is if this approach were to rub off on all the member states .
mr schulz should not try and tell us that he alone advocates social europe .
precisely the opposite is true .
ro the economic crisis is taking a serious toll on europe's enterprises and citizens .
the european union needs economic development and europe's citizens need jobs and decent wages .
unfortunately , energy efficiency , which can create jobs , does not feature in january's regulation .
yesterday's deal on roaming was sensational and the citizens of europe stand to gain from it .
that is why we should also support commissioner kovács in tabling more proposals for progressive depreciation .
that would trigger jobs and growth .
the crisis should be used as a catalyst for economic restructuring , and not just in the car industry .
the decisions we took there were fundamental and important .
i would like to say one thing to those of you who have specific doubts and questions .
the actual decisions on the eur 5 billion for energy projects and broadband internet are important .
many of you ask how we will tackle the problem of unemployment .
many of your comments were concerned with the issue of eu openness .
i would like to reassure those of you who have any doubts concerning a certain matter .
yes , we do have domestic problems and we know full well who initiated the confidence motion .
mr vondra , many colleagues have thanked the czech presidency for its contribution .
i did so at the beginning , in the presence of prime minister topolánek .
i would like to thank you for your very committed personal contribution .
good luck for the continuation of your work .
let me conclude .
whenever I conclude , I see crowds coming in to listen !
laughter 
we can be proud of what we have decided , but there should be no room for complacency .
americans are coming closer to our position regarding the fight against climate change , and we welcome that .
americans are coming closer to the need to reinforce the welfare system .
i wish to express my support for the decisions adopted at the recent european union summit held in brussels .
they have been locked up illegally by the bush administration , which clearly violated international law .
it is , therefore , first and foremost an american problem that needs to be solved by washington .
this is based purely on assumptions .
es mr president , guantánamo is a problem that was not created by the european union .
yet it is clear that we did not create it ourselves .
this is a clear duty that we should carry out .
there is no doubt that each case must be dealt with individually .
the prisoners of guantánamo cannot be dealt with as if they were an undifferentiated herd .
they are people with rights , but also with their own personal stories .
what are the figures for spain , italy or any other member state ?
will europe be able to reform the control of its own secret services ?
will the union be able to rehabilitate the victims via legal processes and compensation ?
i welcome mr barrot's declaration of intent to this end .
the first point of the resolution mentions the important changes in united statespolicy concerning humanitarian laws .
i say this for the attention of the czech presidency , which seems to have a different idea .
i would not wish obama enthusiasts to suffer any early disappointment .
el mr president , the inhumane prison at guantánamo should never have been opened .
not one european government , not one national parliament , has invited us .
let them do so even now , so that this sort of illegal practice is never repeated .
we need to know whether the european union will have the powers and the competency to play a role .
the european union must collaborate .
if we do not do this , we risk being irrelevant in the process of closing guantánamo .
it is not acceptable to say now that this problem is not our business .
i stress that it is not only our moral duty but also our political responsibility .
ro combating terrorism is the number one priority of modern society .
however , mistakes have been committed and controversial decisions have been made in the name of this desired objective .
as regards commissioner barrot's reference to romania , accusations have been made in the past without any basis .
the romanian parliament has carried out an investigation and supplied the results to the interested parties .
i believe that this is totally adequate .
i also believe that romania has given adequate replies to the completely baseless accusations which have been levelled .
de mr president , there is no question that the responsibility for guantánamo lies with the usa .
i am thinking , for example , about the uighurs who cannot return to china .
we cannot decide whether or not they want to live in the usa .
however , one thing must be made clear .
the right to the presumption of innocence must apply in this case .
as the head of a police authority , this minister should pack his bags and go .
we should think carefully about that .
each member state will decide on the basis of its own laws whether to receive them or not .
we look away we turn our back .
for this reason , we must make it clear that the question of credibility is of great political importance .
during the course of this debate , I have sometimes had a quite different impression .
someone today spoke about refugees .
these are not refugees .
european responsibility for violations of the rule of law and human rights cannot be erased .
the position of the european parliament on terrorism is equally clear .
it is a fact that the united states has shouldered most of the burden in the fight against terrorism .
however , they have also made huge mistakes .
it was a huge mistake to create guantánamo .
it was a huge mistake to treat detainees as they did .
it was a huge mistake to transport them as they did .
this has been said in this parliament .
how is the european union involved ?
they wish to destroy our world , which is founded on respect for human rights and devotion to freedom .
the attack on september 11 demonstrated that terrorists are prepared to use any means whatsoever .
the united states undertook to defend the free world on behalf of us all .
europe needs to feel responsible for the war on global terrorism .
often , these methods amounted to torture .
no means deemed inadmissible under signed international conventions may be used .
the chechen nation was murdered before our very eyes .
that should put an end to the debate on secret prisons and transit flights .
this means not just europe , but also the united states , as well as others .
after all , the people in guantánamo bay are prisoners , and not people that can be trifled with .
this is particularly worrying and this concern must be set out in a joint resolution .
i refer to a polish citizen aged 42 who was kidnapped .
he was seized in the border areas between afghanistan and pakistan .
he is a geologist who was working there .
he has been held in the area ever since .
now , we should not have to be asked about accepting guantánamo detainees .
we can decide ourselves to sign a bilateral agreement with the us , as portugal has done .
cohesive leadership is now needed from the irish government in this regard .
mr president , the eu has been asking for the closure of guantánamo for a long time .
moreover , internal investigations have not supported the accusations either .
at the most , it is simply cynical manipulation for obscure purposes .
some of them have not even been charged and duly tried .
obama made a popular gesture and is now deciding what to do with them .
the socialist government of portugal did not collaborate with the bush administration quite the contrary .
mr president , the prison at guantánamo bay was a necessary creation of the united states at the time .
its closure is now a matter for the united states .
torture is unacceptable and there are no exceptional circumstances to alter this truth .
the martin report is the best example of this approach .
it contains accusations against romania which are both controversial and unfounded .
these are classic asylum cases .
europe must learn to speak with one voice and to take united action .
we joined the fight against terrorism to defend human rights .
now we need to be involved in helping the united states to defend human rights .
pl ladies and gentlemen , there are two sides to this matter .
i believe that citizens of a country should be readmitted into their country of origin .
the union is now a unit , and this problem must therefore be considered .
unless they are freed from such stigma , nobody will wish to accept them .
this is a serious problem that merits consideration .
i will conclude by saying that the problem mainly concerns the united states of america .
i believe it was very useful .
it is certainly more complex than that .
graham watson spoke of the need to approach this with one voice .
it is not about washing ourselves but not getting wet .
there is also the tactical debate .
but if we do receive a request , we need to be prepared to react .
therefore , the council started to discuss this seriously on the second day after president obama's decision .
this is one level .
so there is an internal imperative for a coordinated approach .
some of you have raised the question of speed can we act faster than we are doing now ?
i think we should be aware that the discussion has only just begun .
it has only been one week .
furthermore , it has to be kept in mind that the primary responsibility for guantánamo rests with the us .
a clear position of the respective member states on the resettlement of detainees is not yet known .
mr president , the commission broadly shares the views expressed by mr vondra .
it is a key turning point in the fight against terrorism .
it is true , however , that initial responsibility lies with the united states .
this really is the essential condition .
the united states must send us a clear and reasoned request for each individual case .
that is absolutely essential .
we could then possibly add financial assistance to facilitate reception in some member states .
i would say in mr vondra's presence that we will naturally work closely with the czech presidency .
terrorism must be combated vigorously , but human rights must still be respected .
the speculation mentioning romania in connection with the cia's secret prisons is totally unfounded .
no one has been able to prove their existence in romania .
both the romanian authorities and public opinion strongly uphold respect for human rights .
may the eu be ashamed of its failure to act .
worrying situation in the retention centres for immigrants , especially in the islands of mayotte and lampedusa debate 
i should like to begin by underlining two fundamental principles which lie at the heart of today's debate .
we have responded by developing , over the last 10 years , an effective eu asylum and migration policy .
all parties stand to gain by such an approach .
the development and shaping of an eu asylum and migration policy depends on your input too .
you have specifically raised the situation on the islands of mayotte and lampedusa .
we should take care to distinguish between the two types of migratory flows in these two cases .
the council will shortly begin consideration of this new proposal and looks forward to working closely with you .
until now , the legislation and practice regarding detention in the member states has varied considerably .
it also , through the most recent legislation , sets commonly agreed standards on return policy .
our asylum and migration policy is thus rooted in the rule of law .
it ensures respect for human rights and for the dignity of the individual .
i am well aware , however , that some of you find this directive insufficient .
we are , of course , talking here about asylum seekers .
we therefore now have a legal framework and it must , of course , be put to use .
i now turn to the questions that parliament wanted to raise in this debate .
this is the case with the presidium project and the european refugee fund emergency measures .
in addition , a few weeks ago , the commission approved emergency aid of eur 7 million .
i am relying on the efforts of mrs ferrero waldner to achieve a quick result in the current negotiations .
i now turn to mayotte .
those are the remarks I wished to make to you .
that is why I will be making these visits to see how things are working on the ground .
i would like , in any case , to thank parliament for having opened this debate .
people residing illegally on the island of mayotte account for 30 % of the population .
yes , you heard correctly , I said 30 % of the population .
this is a percentage which is unknown in our european countries , thank god .
the french authorities are well aware of these difficulties .
work to renovate the current detention centre has just been completed to improve the living conditions of detainees significantly .
this should be open in june 20mr president , ladies and gentlemen ,to thwart illegal immigration , one has to be unkind .
it seems a parody of a policy and yet it is the policy of the italian government .
today , we have spoken about the closure of guantánamo .
most of those who are in lampedusa are asylum seekers .
we often have 180 days of detention , including for those who are fleeing from political persecution or war .
1 200 people died in 2008 when trying to cross the mediterranean .
of those who managed to survive , many went through the torments of lampedusa .
the reports about the tragedies unfolding at our external borders are as plain as day .
the urgency is great , and has been for a while .
this is also what the council has noted time and again but only on paper .
it could almost be considered ironic that we are also voting on the roure report this week .
this report contains our findings further to our visits to all the hot spots , including lampedusa .
the european union is falling short , and not just by a little .
the lack of solidarity is shocking .
nobody , not one single person in this parliament , is suggesting that this is a simple task .
experience has taught us that the council tends to cry off at crucial moments .
and this is quite apart from enforcement .
after the electoral campaign , I shall bring them to his attention .
however , all your statements remain formal and reflect wishful thinking that will not be followed by action .
i fear that this especially applies to your statement , mr vondra .
how will it be spent ?
therefore , what sort of trust can we have in action of this kind ?
they are held in such inhumane and degrading conditions that the centre exploded into a true democratic emergency .
hence , there is a genuine emergency and the cause of it is italian government policy .
the citizens of lampedusa have become aware of this , mrs muscardini .
they have also asked the italian government to modify its position on the centre for temporary stay .
it is good of commissioner barrot to go to lampedusa in the next few days and I appreciate this .
i have prepared a dossier and sent it to mr barrot .
in the next few days , my group , too , will organise a delegation that will visit lampedusa .
after lampedusa , visits were also made to places including the canary islands , the netherlands and poland .
this morning , we discussed the proposal to tackle illegal employment in the absence of the council .
the period within which the member states have to transpose these directives into legislation is two years .
the issue of immigration is urgent , though , and a two year period is too long .
it is shocking that the reception situation at lampedusa should need to be discussed in this manner again .
i would therefore call on the council presidency to make this a priority .
the detention centre was not built to cope with this capacity .
we have known this for three years .
the old nato base is being rebuilt to house more immigrants , but this is not an adequate solution .
i would call on italy to be open and transparent about the treatment of immigrants on lampedusa .
nl everyone has been aware of the problems surrounding lampedusa for years .
capsized ships with unfortunate asylum seekers before the european coasts were , in recent years , a regular occurrence .
europe should dare to send clear messages , for desperate times call for desperate measures .
we should come down hard on human traffickers , and their punishments cannot be severe enough .
only then will a debate such as the one we are holding today prove unnecessary in future .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , nothing in this house surprises me any more .
i am sorry that he is not here in the house .
nevertheless , mr president , some ignorant and stupid things have been said by some people on this occasion .
what is the consequence of this ?
i believe that it is important to give you a few figures .
in 2007 , around 11 000 migrants arrived in lampedusa .
in 2008 , three times as many arrived , about 31 000 .
76 requests were examined in 3 days .
after the assertions that have been made , be patient .
now what counts are the true facts lampedusa and malta and others are carrying a terrible burden .
the citizens are not annoyed with the italian government .
they are annoyed because they themselves can no longer endure this situation .
the decision to end the transfers to italy is creating a real problem of access to asylum procedures .
the detention conditions are degrading and an affront to human dignity .
what therefore should be done ignore the rules ?
enough then of demagoguery !
sv unfortunately , no country can have unrestricted immigration in this world .
when that happens , we must preserve the rule of law .
we must treat these people as free citizens and with respect .
we must protect their human rights pending examination of the question of whether they are asylum seekers or not .
what we are talking about now seems very strange to me .
why should those who arrive on the island of lampedusa be forced to remain there forever ?
they will , naturally , be relocated around the country pending legal examination of their case .
the same must be done in italy .
no individual state , operating on its own , can achieve the required results .
this is important work at both domestic and international level .
that is to say , those who qualify are accepted .
when we visited , the camp had been cleared and the detainees replaced by puppets .
of course , we in the european union must show solidarity .
these represent quite a significant number .
what is happening here and we have visited many camps is appalling and completely inhumane .
mr berlusconi says that they can all go and have a beer whenever they want to .
this shows the level of intelligence which this man has , in other words , none at all .
i want to make this very clear .
this two faced approach is no longer acceptable .
we should not help them .
what has been said is false .
maroni exposed this .
in europe , we are all familiar with the concept of compulsory school attendance .
we should start by allowing the people who are stranded here to have a proper education .
this should be our main objective .
perhaps we can include a preparatory measure in the budget to allow us to offer these people educational opportunities .
mr president , last sunday , a boat carrying 260 immigrants landed on our shores .
the 2 000 arriving in lampedusa over christmas is nothing compared to this !
we are discussing a european issue here and we should include one additional point in the discussion .
none of the people who come to lampedusa or malta have organised a boat for themselves .
they come because they have been enticed by organised crime organisations and have paid a great deal of money .
let me start with the negatives the limitations .
it also does not fall within the council's remit to implement national provisions of the member states .
now is the time to gradually implement that step by step .
there are strategic issues .
europe needs to show greater solidarity .
europe has to decide what solidarity is required .
that is absolutely essential
that is not possible .
that is not the aim of this fund .
i would therefore say to you that we are now going to pay a great deal of attention .
in general terms , I must say that we need the policy of partnership with the countries of origin .
the next item is question time b6 0006 / 09 .
the following questions are addressed to the commission .
european arms markets are fragmented and have consequently suffered adverse economic effects since the 1990s .
is it willing to allow a compensation system ?
this means that the proposal has successfully completed first reading and will shortly be adopted by the council .
it will introduce fair and transparent procurement rules applicable throughout the union .
this will enhance the openness of defence markets between member states to the benefit of all .
offsets aim at fostering the industry of the member state which purchases defence equipment abroad .
economic interests , by contrast , are not sufficient .
the vast majority of member states and parliament agreed with this assessment .
the defence directive does , however , offer alternatives to offsets .
pt I am grateful to the commissioner for the very full answer that I have just received .
subject eu israel trade relations
vice president of the commission . the commission has strongly condemned the violence in gaza .
this crisis proves once more that the israeli palestinian conflict does not have a military solution .
only negotiations with the full commitment of the parties can bring about a lasting solution .
the commission welcomes the recent cessation of hostilities in gaza .
the eu has called on its partners for help in driving the peace process forward .
the immediate priority for the commission is to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of the population in gaza .
trading relations between the eu and israel will continue .
but , commissioner , all our trade agreements have a human rights clause in them .
there will be no change in our trade policy , and further developments depend on the circumstances .
a lot of people have asked for further supplementary questions on this question .
i will , therefore , take supplementary questions from mr allister and mr rack .
i would be pleased if the european union could provide a balanced response in this respect .
vice president of the commission . I can assure you that the commission always tries to be balanced .
we try to be balanced and to consider all aspects of this very complex conflict .
subject internet safety programme
who is eligible to apply to take part in the programme ?
how , and on what activities , will funds from thesafer internetprogramme be spent ?
the commission is convinced that the next one will also be a success .
it facilitates national actions and initiatives in a coordinated fashion .
the 2009 work programme is currently subject to commission inter service consultation .
the commission will then seek the programme management committee's favourable opinion .
pl madam president , commissioner , I warmly welcome this important initiative .
i would simply like to pose one question .
does the commissioner have any information on this and what exactly is contemplated ?
in essence , this means that everything has become much more interactive .
de it is a question of spending the eur 55 million properly .
can you imagine allocating programme funding in the same way as with the eurostars programme ?
as such , both the positive and dangerous sides are very new to society and governmental structures .
the safer internet programme is one response to threats already identified .
another threat already identified is cyber attacks and different attempts to attack and block via the internet .
i can assure you that the commission and its relevant services are monitoring the situation intensely .
therefore , I think it would also be good for those enterprises .
however , I cannot give a concrete answer today on the issue of young people's participation .
subject special adviser richard boomer and the heysel site
his contract has now been extended .
what led the commissioner to extend this contract ?
which decisions by the commissioner has mr boomer influenced ?
which internal meetings in the commission has mr boomer attended since the extension ?
will the commission give its opinion on this site ?
what is the timetable for decision making ?
when will the results of the architectscompetition for the rue de la loi be announced ?
all information about him is available on the website .
this call was made with full transparency , via publication in the official journal .
the commission received nine offers and is currently undertaking a technical examination of them .
according to information available to the european commission , the final result is expected in spring 200i am sorry about the long answer but the details were also substantial .
i have produced a diagram which shows the career of your special advisor .
i would like to ask you how you ensure that no conflicts of interest come about .
one of the people who plays a role in your new offers appears on this diagram .
this is someone who has had a business relationship with your special advisor for a long time .
so how do you ensure that no conflicts of interest occur ?
vice president of the commission . as I said , he must know a lot of people .
i am absolutely sure that there is no conflict of interest .
he has not expressed any kind of suggestion concerning our future policy decisions .
i am absolutely sure you will hear when this decision is taken .
nine sites have been suggested , but I do not know where these sites are .
i have read in newspapers about some suggestions made .
so far , nothing is clear , so I am very interested to see all these proposals .
de I would like to query something again .
we understand that a search is going on for property outside the european area .
however , specific changes of use have been introduced at one site , the heysel site .
it will be a very clear and transparent decision .
so , to have other sites as well is a necessity , especially to moderate the costs .
that is the main idea .
we already have some buildings and some sites outside the european quarter .
we have buildings in beaulieu , we have buildings on the rue de genève and some others also .
we are interested in looking .
you mentioned heysel .
i read about it in the newspapers .
i do not know anything about heysel .
nothing has been decided .
it is a process .
it will be a transparent process .
i suggest , though , that we keep out of belgian internal debates and interests .
subject euro note and coin counterfeiting
so it is closely monitored .
the roles are divided .
the european central bank is responsible for the coordination of the fight against counterfeiting of euro banknotes .
the commission , especially its olaf service , deals with the counterfeiting of coins .
it is important to mention that europol is playing a substantial role in fighting counterfeiting .
so this is the situation with regard to the counterfeiting of euro banknotes and coins .
in the united states , to counterfeit the currency is a serious crime .
do we take the same attitude in the european union ?
vice president of the commission . first , the turkish lira is very well known to me .
so this has been promised at least .
subject efficient spending of the eu budget
the system is as follows .
there is a special spending programme , which has its own legal basis .
next comes implementation , where there are different layers .
this is one internal part .
what is also important in this particular part is that there is shared management .
there is also improvement in this area .
a completely new instrument has been introduced the so called annual summary of all reports of paying agencies .
these were carefully analysed for the first time last year and this is now being done again .
so the situation is improving .
this quantification of changes also shows that there has been an improvement .
so european money is quite rigidly managed even too rigidly in some areas .
we can show what has been done .
but we can also clearly say that this is far from perfect .
this is a huge machine which must work smoothly .
the number of correction decisions relating to the structural funds has increased tremendously during this period .
but 11 % represented eur 462 million .
does the commissioner think that this is acceptable ?
this is a mess , commissioner !
can we expect that this is going to be improved ?
these samples amount to eur 63 million .
all these samples have been corrected , recovered and the necessary documents provided .
therefore , the 12 % issue from 2006 is resolved .
errors are not a waste of money errors are errors which are corrected .
meanwhile , the court of auditors has submitted this discharge , this report .
these are the possible fraud cases .
would you support this idea ?
this would provide a model of efficiency for using european public money .
i would like to ask the commission what its point of view is on this .
it is a question of opening the staff regulations , which is a very complicated issue .
concerning the funds , I did not understand the question .
were you suggesting that all the funds should be merged ?
could you repeat the question ?
i think it would be very useful for the sustainable economic development of the european union .
vice president of the commission . that is a huge question .
i can only pass this question to my colleagues .
so far , it has been a very heated debate in the council .
there are some opportunities to support energy efficiency through the cohesion funds .
but to establish some kind of new fund will probably create a lot of very long debates .
the idea , of course , I can only support .
subject agreements with andean community countries
all of them are invited , of course .
vice president of the commission . I think that this particular question is quite difficult .
vice president of the commission . yes , I can definitely say that this is the commission's approach .
this was a really big achievement .
so we will try , of course , to have this multilateral approach .
subject the removal of the pmoi from the eu's terrorist list
what is the position of the commission which should safeguard the rule of law in this respect ?
in particular , the reasons for the listing had not been communicated in advance of the decision .
the organisation was therefore not in a position to make its views known before a decision was taken .
i should like to thank the commissioner .
let me make it clear that I condemn terrorism in all its forms .
i assume the council and other european institutions will follow the court's decisions .
but I have not been informed that we have had any reaction from the iranian government .
on the contrary , colleagues say that there has been no reaction from the iranian government .
that seems to me to be a good step .
member of the commission . this list is , of course , constantly being revised .
so this is a process which is dynamic it is not fixed forever .
there must be reasons for any new approach , but it can be revised if there are new reasons .
subject future eu iceland relations
we could not have imagined discussing the potential radical changes in eu iceland relations .
the commission is closely following this debate .
i can assure you that we will handle the application as expediently as possible .
such a move would not have a positive impact on eu iceland relations .
how would the union be able to deal with such a request quickly , if this could be done ?
the negotiations will be the same as with all other candidate countries .
i do not see any possibility of having some kind of fast track for these negotiations .
whether iceland is , perhaps , quite well prepared for membership is another issue .
this is my opinion .
there has never been any talk in the commission of any special treatment or fast track .
vice president of the commission . these are both quite specific questions .
concerning the fisheries agreement , again , this is a very specific question .
however , I seem to remember that this issue was mentioned several times in previous enlargement negotiations .
i think this will be the key element in future negotiations .
thank you , commissioner , and thank you for helping us this evening with so many questions .
subject demography report
these are described in the attached surveys of individual countries .
however , the commission may act as a catalyst for change , to support efforts of member states .
thank you for your answer , commissioner .
you talk about the needs of an ageing population .
certainly care giving is one of those .
you mentioned that family carers come within the remit of the member states , and I agree with that .
you also mentioned in reply to me that the european social fund could be used for training .
i would like you perhaps to elaborate more on that .
as for the funding for these people , that is a matter for the member states .
this is one of the reasons why we are aiming in this direction .
the task is simply too difficult and they cannot cope .
we wish to take action on this issue too , through the european social fund .
as the author is not present , question 51 lapses .
subject poverty in the european union
since then , the union has set up instruments for achieving that goal .
this cooperation between member states has had very good results .
all the relevant policies have therefore been brought to bear in the fight against social exclusion .
the renewed social agenda also proposes strengthening the open method of coordination .
author . I would like to thank the commissioner for his very comprehensive answer .
very often , in economically difficult times , young people unfortunately get into drug abuse .
this depends on the decisions of individual project sponsors , local communities , and decisions at national level .
the sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. 
protection of minorities in europe debate 
is the european union credible when it condemns violations of human and minority rights in third countries ?
we cannot sweep these problems under the carpet !
the citizens of europe expect us to provide genuine answers .
subsidiarity and self governance , power sharing and joint decision making are the fundamental values of the european union .
the copenhagen criteria are aimed specifically at candidates for accession to the union .
however , the union does not have general powers in the area of the protection of minority rights .
the adoption of the framework decision against racism and xenophobia on 28 november is a further example .
the union has also acted concerning the situation of the roma minority .
the integration of immigrants is an important and growing issue for the member states of the european union .
the european commission's policy on multilinguism includes regional languages as well as the languages spoken by minorities .
respect for linguistic and cultural diversity is one of the cornerstones of the european union .
this will allow us to update the report on racism which dealt with the year 200that is what I can tell you .
in other words , we do not have a legal basis for organising the protection of minorities .
likewise , migration has taken place both at the individual level and with the movement of entire ethnic communities .
we have inherited the results of all this .
acceptance of the treaty would be a great step forward in the history of the european union .
it cannot abandon minorities at this time of crisis .
nearly a tenth of eu citizens currently belong to a national , linguistic or ethnic minority .
some , like myself , as a swedish speaking finn , are treated well .
others are discriminated against or disavowed .
immigrants require special support to help them integrate into their new homelands .
russia's involvement and propaganda in estonia and latvia , for example , is a cautionary example .
we must not put weapons in the hands of those who want to harm us .
it would also be important for this parliamentary committee to be given explicit responsibility for issues relating to minorities .
this parliament should approve a statement on the rights of minorities .	
they share this view .
i believe that the roma need more support from the state .
in particular , they need assistance with vocational training and with education in general .
member states should play the leading role regarding the integration of this and other minority groups .
common union legislation would be very helpful to us in our endeavours , however .
however , in many countries , this respect is weak or non existent .
this leads to discrimination in which minorities are abused and relegated to the poorest of circumstances .
this negates the purpose of the agreement .
hungary is indeed where ethnic minorities have been almost completely eliminated over the past decades .
the words of the former ombudsman for minorities in hungary , jenö kaltenbacha , confirm this .
in those schools , slovak is taught for four hours a week .
in the hungarian minority schools , the language of instruction is exclusively hungarian .
slovak is taught as a supplementary language for a few hours each week .
on the other hand , only hungarian priests officiate in hungarian communities in slovakia .
such attitudes need to be unmasked and vigorously condemned within the european parliament as well .
they live within european member states while never having moved from their ancestral lands .
this is why eu regulation is necessary and why the assistance of the eu is necessary .
with the recent enlargement towards the east , the situation has , unavoidably , become far more complex .
it has its own characteristics and suffers the greatest disadvantages of all minority groups of any kind .
each social group is different .
hu mr president , one out of every ten european citizens belongs to a national minority .
many of them feel that they are stepchildren within their own homeland .
they look to the european union to guarantee their rights and help improve their situation .
ratification of the lisbon treaty could improve the situation , but in itself , it is no magic solution .
this would give a clear signal that the minorities are also full citizens of a unifying europe .
europe cannot have stepchildren , since in one sense or another , all of us are minorities .
in the countries of the former communist camp , the principle of non intervention was supreme .
faced with poverty or danger , some people flee their country of origin to seek refuge .
the right to asylum is a way for people to vote with their feet .
in this instance , the duty is to accept the rules , languages and customs of the receiving countries .
the right of asylum is a precious right as it is a right inherent to the human being .
even if you belong to a minority , this does not legitimise the creation of a community right .
your ultimate allegiance must always be to the country in which you settle .
over time , this will only create either a field of indifference or a field for a battle .
you should either love your receiving country or get out .
that is the duty which is born of the freedom to come and go .
we do not need either to adopt the provisions of the council of europe .
a specific mention must be made about the roma minority .
it could cause enormous human unhappiness .
mr president , I would like to thank mr tabajdi for his excellent work .
it is regrettable that we are not able to conclude our debates with a resolution .
i am firmly convinced that minority rights must become a part of the acquis communautaire .
unfortunately , the commission is very reluctant to suggest any measures in this field .
let us not forget that respect for , and protection of , minorities is one of the copenhagen criteria .
the commission does not even apply the criteria properly during the accession process .
hu thank you very much , mr president .
there are few political territories within the european union where a double standard is in effect .
we often witnesses the strengthening of assimilationist efforts allegedly in the minority's own interest .
the establishment of internal legal standards to protect the legal status of minorities is unavoidable .
perhaps the method of open coordination may be helpful in this regard , until a legal basis is created .
finally , I would like to thank mr tabajdi for his excellent work in this area .
romania has allowed its minorities to enjoy national rights which extend beyond relevant european standards .
indeed , the presence in this chamber of romanian meps who are ethnic hungarians is living proof of this .
the european project is about integration and not about creating enclaves based on ethnic criteria .
this is a loss to representative democracy .
the speaker continued in basque 
eskerrik asko jaun andreok zuen laguntzagatik europako hizkuntza guztien alde .
yet , for the sustainability of our multi ethnic society , is there any alternative to higher education ?
real life examples show that solving issues related to education fuels strong community development .
education is , by its own nature , unifying rather than divisive .
in fact , it teaches us that we are all someone else's minority .
where the need arises , higher degree education in the language of minorities is part of the national educational system .
let me give you the example of sapientia university in romania .
ro the council of europe is the institution which deals with respect for human rights .
the protection of migrant minorities is part of the principles promoted by social europe .
no one asked them whether they wanted to change nationalities or adopt a new official language .
these traditional national minorities are the most loyal citizens of their respective countries .
their loyalty has been unbroken .
my country , romania , has been in existence in its current form since 19there are several other member states besides romania that have similar concerns .
i therefore fully support the elaboration of a comprehensive regulation for the protection of minority rights at european level .
i also want to tell the italian minorities who live abroad that they would otherwise not have this possibility .
mr barrot spoke today about non discrimination .
for this reason , we need positive discrimination in certain situations .
this , I believe , is a new idea , an idea that needs to be pursued .
the european union has competencies .
i would be happier if the representatives of these minorities said that they were well treated .
we must work towards unity in cultural diversity .
in such cases , it is indeed an immense challenge for a single country .
we owe equal rights to all european citizens , irrespective of their ethnic background .
they enjoy extensive political and social rights , identical to those enjoyed by all citizens .
this is an obvious and welcome approach .
i would like to give you an example where the reality contradicts the assertions being made .
we are talking here about a community of more than 100 000 romanians .
this would be the second church for romanians living in serbia .
for his audacity in constructing the first one , father alexandru was given a two month suspended sentence .
i believe that romania offers a model of good practice for very many countries in the european union .
parliament must take responsibility for elaborating and adopting a framework regulation that is binding on all member states .
cultural and linguistic diversity must be preserved , as it is the basis for a healthily functioning union .
fr mr president , I have two questions for the commissioner .
this , of course , requires clarification .
thirdly , mr beazley raised the question of double standards .
it is true that , despite the problems , the situation of the hungarian community in romania is better .
there are problems in romania , but the situation is better than in alsace or brittany .
fourthly , let us talk about territorial autonomy .
at the end of the day , satisfied minorities are factors for stability in the countries of europe .
that is the reality and I would like to thank you for the debate .
mr tabajdi has just listed a whole raft of problems .
the open method of coordination has been mentioned , but this method too requires us to have competence .
that is as much as I am able to say .
i cannot go any further , because we do not have the legal tools .
the member states will not allow us to .
in the wake of this summit , mr špidla is going to establish a european platform on the roma .
this flexible structure will allow us to rise to the challenges at eu level .
i would like to conclude by saying that I have been touched by what has been said here .
that said , there is nothing to stop countries informally exchanging good practices or best practices .
no country in contemporary europe denies the rights of minorities .
it appears that europe is of one mind on this .
nowadays , anyone who queries the rights of minorities will certainly not succeed in the world of politics .
article 11 of the latter provides for the use of minority languages , including on street signs .
i have been chairman of arad county council and the romania west regional authority .
the rights of national minorities in eu member states constitute an important issue in terms of human rights .
this provokes a reaction by the majority .
this has happened , for example , to poles in germany .
the case of people who have arrived in our countries from outside europe is quite different .
clearly , these individuals have the right to their own culture and language .
voting rights for non citizens of latvia in local elections debate 
this is an aberration in the european union .
this is not acceptable .
we have examined specific cases in the committee on petitions .
i do not have another passport .
i do not have another country .
i only have this country and I cannot vote . 
that is an aberration .
how is that possible ?
the recommendations of the european parliament and numerous other institutional organisations have been completely ignored .
a large part of latvia's population has been alienated from the state and its institutions .
no wonder the naturalisation rate is slow .
they do not participate .
they do not take decisions .
is this situation good or bad for the european union ?
democracy cannot flourish without civil society , and there is no civil society without participation .
participation begins at local community level .
the eu must take action on their behalf .
why does the commission not act on this ?
this does not conform to the european union , its principles or its values .
these people are called non citizens .
this is , quite simply , unacceptable .
i do not believe it should be tolerated .
those languages were simply banned .
today , the reality is that they are co official .
i take exception to that .
the commission is aware of the specific circumstances in which the russian speaking minority in latvia find themselves .
the commission therefore cannot talk to latvia regarding the issue of these people's participation in local elections .
it is up to the member states to decide such issues .
when speaking about russian speaking non citizens , one cannot use the concept of atraditional minority.
why that is , I do not know .
what does that mean ?
on behalf of the pse group . mr president , commissioner barrot's response was very disappointing .
i would have expected a more positive response from him , despite the legal constraints that he operates under .
i am from ireland I speak english .
english is my mother tongue , but I am not english I am irish .
the reality is that the european union is made up of many states .
we must encourage them to participate politically .
one of the largest migrant communities in ireland is british .
they can all vote in local elections in ireland .
such a position is also in line with international law and practice .
latvia aims to have citizens with full rights , instead of having non citizens with many rights .
the majority of latvia's businesses belong to russian entrepreneurs .
these are arguments that permit us to reject the complaints against the latvian state .
let us not therefore prevent them from living in their world of past values !
the latvian non citizens are not nationals of any state and they have no right to participate in any elections .
this is a unique case in parliamentary history .
the commissioner spoke only of the integration of non citizens into society and their naturalisation .
latvia was invaded by stalin , then by hitler , and then by stalin again .
the latvian population was then subjected to imprisonment , deportations and executions .
stalin then imported not only russian speakers , but ukrainian speakers and belarussian speakers .
i think that is important , not just for latvia , but for all our countries .
do not ask for privileges if you do not want to play your part .
you can take citizenship .
there was a palestinian exile who took latvian citizenship .
if he could learn the language , I am sure that those russian speaking latvians can do the same .
of course we are reminded that the great majority have taken citizenship .
if you are part of a country , I think you have rights and duties .
hu I wish to congratulate alexandra dobolyi and her fellow authors .
this is one of the most serious human rights issues in the european union today .
i am well acquainted with the practice , but nothing can justify historical revenge .
well , that is quite sad .
a historical compromise must be found between the latvian majority and the russian minority .
this is the only solution , there is no other .
latvia's citizenship law is one of the most generous in europe .
any non citizen can acquire full rights , including the right to vote , by becoming a citizen .
their arrival is a direct consequence of the occupation of latvia implemented by the soviet union .
sv what are the consequences for the latvian people of fifty years of soviet occupation ?
why does a large proportion of the russian speaking population not want to apply for citizenship ?
what is russia's part in all this ?
compulsory schooling involves learning the language of the country and possibly other languages .
in addition , students learn about history .
compulsory schooling , as we understand it , helps people to live together in harmony .
this is the purpose served by a good compulsory schooling system .
mr president , I have listened carefully to both sides .
unfortunately , that is all I can say .
the sitting was closed at 10 55 p.m. 
the sitting was opened at 9 a.m. 
action taken on parliament's resolutions see minutes
the procedure in a horizontal committee was new .
that has been the greatest advantage of this committee .
we know very well that prohibitions , sanctions and doing without achieve very little .
instead , we must encourage changes in awareness as well as innovation and motivation .
the report is also honest .
we have stated that we do not have any super weapons .
the report is therefore directed at us all .
that is the wonderful thing about it .
i am particularly pleased about that .
nor does it disparage any area .
the amount will increase , and we must work on this to bring about innovation .
i just said that we should involve our citizens so that they can do something in their own houses .
if we understand that , then this task has been worthwhile .
its tireless efforts have greatly contributed towards shaping the eu position on climate change .
as you know , the work during the presidency will focus on the international negotiation process .
the copenhagen conference is now only 10 months away .
this encompasses further mitigation efforts , adaptation actions and finance and technology means to make that response operational .
i have spoken on the phone to carol browner , the president's assistant for energy and climate change .
last year , our priority was the package of measures on climate change and energy .
our efforts bore fruit and we can now be proud of this very important package of legislative acts .
your report has therefore come along at the right time .
one illustrative example is the proposal which the commission tabled recently on the energy efficiency of buildings .
nonetheless , I believe that agreement will be reached in copenhagen .
we can and must reach an agreement .
there is no time to lose .
it is a question of political will and I think that the will exists .
one illustrative element is the measures announced recently for cars .
comparability will be of decisive importance both in achieving the environmental targets and in safeguarding fair terms of competition .
the commission has proposed a series of criteria for defining comparability .
this means that we shall obviously be expecting more from the rapidly developing economies than from the others .
furthermore , one part needs to be public funding and we must examine ways of securing these public funds .
today , in the midst of a recession , this will not be an easy debate .
international negotiations will proceed apace and intense diplomatic work will be needed on our part this year .
i welcome your contribution to this major effort .
our discussions were quite dynamic at times , precisely because of the diversity of the views expressed .
personally , I think that it would be a good idea if we pursued this particular methodology .
however , that alone will not be enough .
in this regard , we need to achieve much more when it comes to information campaigns and awareness raising .
i also agree with the comments made about the correlation between the financial crisis and climate change .
since our objective is to limit global temperature increases , we also need to work internationally , of course .
it has , in my view , become an all encompassing report with nearly 200 recommendations , and really worthwhile .
i would like to mention five core themes that are really essential for our group .
all these areas deserve our full attention and an effective solution .
secondly , climate policy should also have a social dimension and should show solidarity .
we need to address employment , income aspects and energy poverty .
we need to know how new technology will be paid for , and who will bear that cost .
we want to know how many jobs will be created and whether any jobs will be lost .
we want retraining programmes for the new green poll workers .
without maximum social dedication , it is extremely difficult to maintain political support for climate policy .
our third core theme is related to the economic crisis , where we once again need a comprehensive solution .
the green new deal has now become a concept , and one that receives our wholehearted support .
considerable investments are needed .
interventions to support banks and businesses should at least have a sustainable component .
our fourth core theme is agriculture .
this is usually not something we discuss when we talk about the climate .
what is also clear is that agriculture does not only pose a problem , it also offers solutions .
sound agriculture , effective land use and an appropriate use of biomass can help reduce greenhouse gases .
our fifth core theme , finally , is about involving people .
this requires the provision of information and transparency .
local initiatives are very valuable in this regard .
free energy audits for houses , better public transport and local and regional food production .
together , we can achieve a great deal .
with this set of measures , there is also reason for optimism .
i am indebted to all fellow members who have made a contribution to this .
it is the fact that human population is growing at unprecedented and unsustainable levels .
in the lifetimes of many of us here , population on this planet will have trebled .
it continues to grow at the rate of 200 000 every day 80 million a year .
why does china need a new coal fired power station every week ?
the minister is flying to india today .
population growth is even faster there and again they are turning to coal for energy .
contraception must be available for all .
women must have control over their reproductive lives it is so preferable to the alternative of unsafe abortion .
our refusal to place it there is the greatest folly .
families everywhere should be talking about this .
governments should be setting targets for population stability or reduction .
we need to reduce bureaucracy and support smes and technology developers .
the market is there .
the regulatory framework is clear .
we have set the targets for renewable energy .
although funding is scarce , it is crucial to technology development and to maintaining expertise .
banks and funders will have to take risks on green technology start ups .
there will be long term gain if we step up to the mark .
the jobs and wealth will flow .
for example , ireland could become to ocean wave technology what finland is to mobile phone technology .
we have the undisputed potential due to weather and location in the atlantic .
we have the technology patented .
we have the expertise in situ and we have the legal target framework .
delays at this point would be detrimental .
green technology is our future .
we have the opportunity now , so let us use it .
the length of the report is evidence of the huge number of issues there were to deal with .
i can see that any legislation at european level relating to this issue will be establishing new ground .
i would like to mention three things in particular .
we are also demanding measures to be taken in respect of the meat industry .
a large proportion of this feed is exported to europe as soya .
this is not sustainable .
the car industry is another growing problem .
between 1990 and 2005 , emissions from the european transport industry increased by 32 % .
a huge investment in public transport and other environmentally friendly transport is needed .
we need to ask ourselves whether the situation with all these forms of transport is sustainable .
should we not encourage local production and consumption instead ?
if they are adopted , my group will be unable to support this resolution .
therefore , please vote against amendments 12 and thank you very much .
we should not , therefore , get too bogged down by short term events .
to reduce or prevent the negative effects of climate change , tough action is needed across a wide area .
we need tough goals for the period between 2020 and 20not one section of society should escape making efforts .
this report makes a particularly valuable contribution towards this .
mr president , 500 years ago there was a consensus amongst learned men that the world was flat .
they were wrong .
they were wrong .
weapon systems would fail , commerce would stop , aircraft would fall out of the sky .
they were wrong .
nothing at all happened .
today we are told there is a consensus around catastrophic man made global warming .
it , too , is wrong .
nor is it a consensus .
ice caps have shrunk on mars , yet nobody imagines that industrial emissions or 4x4s are to blame .
the latest set of measures was the recently approved energy package .
the report that we have before us is , as has already been said , a set of recommendations .
the only way we can be really effective is to improve efficiency .
i would , however , like to focus on the content .
i have here some statistics on our work .
i personally would argue that it is a success , if only a modest one .
at present the equal conditions that will convince people in developing countries to espouse this policy are still lacking .
it is somewhat too eurocentric and somewhat too compartmentalised as well .
we are looking at a lifestyle change .
it mr president , ladies and gentlemen , my compliments to president florenz .
we are failing in not bringing sufficient ambition to this debate .
the latest science tells us we need to be reducing emissions by around 9 % year on year .
the targets set out in this report and in the eu's climate package are simply not ambitious enough .
we are failing in not bringing enough urgency to this debate .
we are failing in not being consistent .
today , we speak of renewables and energy efficiency .
that debate urgently needs to be begun , and the eu is very well placed to start it .
these reduction targets cannot be met without serious diminution in food production .
twenty per cent by 2020 was a start but only a start .
with the obama presidency , we have the opportunity to stop exchanging words and start exchanging ideas .
we hear that a meeting will take place on 6 march 200with the united states , we can now move to that 30 % target and beyond .
we need to move on to shipping and to agricultural emissions .
the commissioner has referred to the urgent need to talk to the low income countries in the developing world .
they will be devastated , but they did not cause this problem .
devastation will come to agriculture .
they must take action , but they need our help .
i may be wrong about the possible flu pandemic .
i may be wrong about the probable impact of global warming .
however , the majority of scientists may be right the majority of politicians may be right .
many are sceptical about whether the committee on climate change will bring added value to parliament's work .
that leads to credible results , as we can see .
the mindset in the european union has long been that we need action to prevent climate change .
we have , however , lacked the financial instruments .
sv this report promises a great deal .
no measures are proposed with regard to the protection of land and soil .
alternative fuels are also treated with far too much restraint .
there are options here , too .
in this regard , we needed to come up with more with regard to growth and jobs .
it is , of course , possible to create jobs in europe .
they are needed here .
we need to anchor the measures in economic policy .
we must create a basis for development in the field of energy .
do you not understand this ?
it covers all major areas of social life that have a bearing on the dramatic increase in climate change .
it is high time for us to prepare necessary measures within an eu context .
the situation in agriculture and in securing sufficient food for human consumption will also become very serious .
to my climate sceptic friends , could I say that the precautionary principle should be considered .
i would recommend it to them .
i should like to thank karl heinz florenz for his report .
they have all done an excellent job and provided a good basis for the work in the future parliament .
the report before us is long it makes many points .
so we have to get this package of measures right .
dorette corbey talked about what can be done in the way of energy efficiency measures .
climate policy cannot stand alone , but needs to be incorporated into all of our legislation .
there is not much time left .
we have now adopted our climate package within the eu here in parliament .
this is something that the governments of the eu need to take note of .
we need to think long term .
extra quotas for industry , while fostering its competitiveness , nonetheless make it difficult to obtain funding .
this could be done by centrally covering part of the costs of making the changes .
europe must act as a pioneer and take charge of realistic , necessary measures on an international basis .
this is completely short sighted .
madam president , we have here an ambitious plan .
a plan to do nothing less than save the world a big job at the best of times .
this simple statement was the first to be attacked and removed .
what was so objectionable to the committee ?													  
because creation has a creator .
it does not matter to me how the universe was created , or in what time frame .
well , all I can say is good luck with it , and may god spare us .
i do not want discuss the details of this report .
in my opinion , it should simply be adopted .
during numerous months of discussions on the subject , far reaching amendments were made to this package .
this has been our great achievement .
commissioner , it is an excellent decision .
we must now speedily examine it in parliament .
another very important issue is the fact that we need to base our work on a global agreement .
that is the assumption behind mr florenz's report .
that is what is most important to us today .
the problem now is to find out how we can implement all the report's recommendations .
we must urgently find means of fighting global warming .
the european commission estimates that an annual investment of eur 175 billion is required to fight global warming .
with a budget of eur 76 billion , we are wide of the mark .
we must face up to the consequences of climate change there is no question about that .
it is only the means for doing so chosen by the report that I cannot fully support .
europe leading the way is not enough to convince the rest of the world .
secondly , with our current level of knowledge , renewable energies cannot completely replace fossil energy sources .
it may be motivating on a political level to demand that , but it is not realistic .
the political will , as great as that may be , will not nullify any physical laws .
thirdly , biofuels are hailed as environmentally friendly alternatives .
fourthly , a means of mobility that protects resources in the long term is a reasonable goal .
unfortunately , the german liberals cannot give their support to this .
however , global warming has always started a dozen or so centuries before any increase in carbon dioxide levels .
if we acknowledged this fact , mankind would save billions of dollars by giving up pointless activities .
the money saved could be spent on the fight against poverty and on new technologies .
what a climatic masterstroke .
madam president , a mystique bordering on a religious creed has grown up around this alleged global warming .
the global warming theory has cast co2 , a natural constituent of the atmosphere , as a demon gas .
it does have the effect slightly of trapping heat around the world , but how ?
you need to draw a graph showing how co2 perhaps causes warming .
we are nearly on the flat line , if not already there .
extra co2 will have no more effect .
there is no problem .
madam president , I would like to thank mr florenz .
this is a rich report with a great number of concrete proposals .
all these factors will accelerate warming .
we can control emissions but we cannot control these factors .
that is why some of us advocate very strongly the 350 ppm target .
this dimension of the problem is referred to in the report but only in passing .
i would have liked it to be at the core of the report .
finally , let me just endorse what guido sacconi said .
what is needed from us today ?
climate change is bringing about broader democratic participation by society , a society which lives with different cultural values .
the answer lies in making the economy green and making businesses , households and the government sustainable .
if they want qualifications for workers , they are up against policy that is very compartmentalised .
this report calls for an integrated approach that also hangs together territorially .
fortunately , my amendment on the use of regions and cities has been adopted .
they will be following the conclusions of this report , close to the citizens and close to business .
this is the right approach , in my view .
as such , this approach can count on my backing .
i am opposed to the over simplified approach towards the agricultural sector in paragraph 189 , though .
as such , we will oppose this paragraph .
there is also massive uncertainty which means that security is so important .
however , we must also look to the future .
however , commissioner , madam president , we still have the challenge of putting it across to our citizens .
de madam president , the florenz report actually contains a lot of good suggestions .
this is shown very clearly in the report along with many opportunities for new technologies and economic development .
however , I think it is a shame that we have excluded large areas of science .
corresponding applications were rejected by the majority , and that was that .
science is only what fits into the political concept .
this will not work , because science does not allow itself to be manipulated .
thus , the report will , unfortunately , hit rocky ground in the end .
and anyone who demands protective clothing against the effects of the climate is deliberately stirring up anxiety .
i hope that these radical and misplaced ideologies will not be included in the report .
today we have in front of us the final report to be put to the vote .
through the committee's method of working , this report has also succeeded in achieving a horizontal viewpoint .
the fight against climate change cannot be waged by europe alone .
we must also get other continents and countries on board .
when we talk about adaptation measures then we are also talking about funding .
water plays a central role in climate change .
until now rainwater has been regarded as waste water which had to be disposed of as quickly as possible .
the new approach for water is based on the principle that rainwater is the key to life .
i am delighted that it will be introduced by an expert group of czech and slovak scientists .
this is an interesting approach , minister bursík .
i believe that it will win your support .
it is important not to give up on such a complex problem .
we face a challenge and we must act now because our actions today will determine our future .
we will prevail only if we give thegreen lightto all progressive solutions in europe .
residents of lithuania and the other baltic countries really thirst for a european electric energy network .
the call to increase structural fund money , used to heat multi apartment dwellings , is very important .
miracles rarely happen .
let us go beyond discussion .
let us make sure that the member states make a solid commitment .
yet , there is something we should be worried about .
2009 is a european election year , when the european commission will change .
it is a way of reducing energy bills , which will please consumers .
yes , the fight against climate change is one of the responses to the economic crisis .
i have recommended the development of greener forms of tourism such as sports tourism or cultural tourism .
i feel that we must consider creating an international fund for planting trees on unused landmass .
what is needed ?
every initiative we have launched must be speeded up .
it is not enough to talk about these things we must make them a reality .
what sort of things , for example ?
a common european airspace , a single european sky and our management systems .
above all , we must deal with our cities and other difficult areas .
ultimately , this is perhaps the most difficult task .
unfortunately , I found no facts in that report , only a belief in the infallibility of ipcc reports .
agriculture is particularly affected by climate change , as its products are produced in the open air .
agriculture is often depicted as the big cause of climate change .
this shows that agriculture should not be depicted as an environmental villain .
energy is another important area in which agriculture contributes to the fight against climate change .
for example , agriculture in austria consumes approximately 2.2 % of the energy generated .
the proportion of renewable energy is 23 % , a large share of which again belongs to agriculture .
great importance must .
our greatest challenge now is to establish the next international climate treaty .
climate protection can be accomplished , but the measures need to be swift and consistent .
madam president , I would like to thank the rapporteur .
the report would perhaps be better without them .
neither one country , nor a union can separately and independently handle the challenges of climate change .
therefore we need to integrate policies on a horizontal and vertical plane .
policy , legislation and finances must work together .
the report provides a fantastic platform for this .
without this we are left to triviality and the mundane .
i appeal for investing in science and designating climate change as an important priority for all eu scientific programmes .
the transport sector must reduce co2 emissions by 20 % by 20therefore , I would like to urge states to apply tax incentives and encourage people to use public transport .
in france , we speak of athéodule committee.
i wonder about the future of this report from the point of view of its integration into european policies .
no sooner had it been adopted what is more , unanimously this excellent report was buried completely .
perhaps if we had introduced it into european policies , we would not be here now .
i would like to speak to the rapporteur , who denies that he is presenting a political project .
so , yes , we must be more ambitious and we await the results .
we had a lot of experts in the committee , that is true .
unfortunately , however , they represented only one view .
we did not get the chance to hear all sides of the debate .
i think this was a mistake .
it makes no sense constantly to resort to new regulations and new measures .
the only solution can be to sayyesto innovation andyesto research .
in the long term , objectives will be more compatible .
research has to be undertaken in view of dwindling stocks .
this will result in the disappearance of whole species .
i am therefore extremely critical of parts of the eu's fisheries policy .
a definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in the fisheries sector .
i voted in favour of this report .
in writing . I voted in favour of mrs miguélezreport on fisheries research .
we are extremely critical of parts of the eu's fisheries policy on environmental grounds .
a definite environmental perspective should permeate all research in the fisheries sector to which extra resources are allocated .
i support the report's intention to facilitate the mobility of professionals and to guarantee the safety of consumers .
therefore I abstained in the final vote on the report .
therefore I abstained on final vote on the report .
i therefore voted in favour of this report .
there are also good reasons to seek an end to what is referred to asscientific whaling.
in writing . it madam president , I voted for the report .
the observatory helps to surmount these obstacles by providing expertise and systematic information to the operators concerned .
unfortunately , however , often the legislation adopted by the european community is not sufficiently publicised in italy .
when distributing audiovisual goods there is often a problem of insufficient knowledge of differences in national legislation .
these networks help to improve the quality of the observatory's economic and legal analysis .
it is for the member states to become involved in and fund the european audiovisual observatory .
employers must not be able to avoid applying labour law rules by utilising a complex chain of subcontractors .
we believe that people without documents are just as vulnerable , even if they are working for private individuals .
it was with this hope that I voted in favour of this report .
there is an absence of this type of legislation in certain countries within the eu .
other countries have legislation , but it is not implemented or observed .
the proposal that we are voting on today has many shortcomings .
finally , president barroso , no eu taxes , thank you we already have enough taxes .
es mr president , I wish to direct my comments to mr barroso .
however , you have just totally surprised me .
we represent many european citizens and you have demonstrated contempt for all our voters .
these proposals do not even include what you yourself have defended during your term as commission president .
unfortunately , president barroso , in a democracy you cannot please everyone .
some people do not like you because you are too european , and others because of ideological prejudice .
others want to postpone the decision .
postponing it would create a vacuum and would weaken both the commission and europe .
the world is not waiting for us .
the world is not standing still while europe sets its house in order and elects its leaders .
postponing a decision would be to accept that europe is irrelevant in a more global world .
good luck , president barroso , and success in your work .
now you are saying that you will do everything I have asked for .
how can we suddenly start believing what you say ?
in the next few weeks , you will have the time to prove that you really take this seriously .
these members will support you tomorrow .
we believe that the commission is rather less strong today than it was five years ago .
there , mr barroso , are some of the questions facing you .
it is on this basis that we shall judge your future actions .
thank you for listening .
we need properly coordinated economic and fiscal policies in europe .
we need collaboration on tax in europe , which will put an end to tax dumping .
this will represent a green environmental revolution .
this allowed the european union financial sector to invest most profitably in those countries .
this costs both their citizens and the european commission , as the lender of this money , dear .
a speedier introduction of the euro in these countries would reduce these costs and create stability .
mr president , I opposed the nomination of mr barroso as president of the commission .
like caesar augustus , mr barroso is sending his emissaries to tell the irish people what they should do .
mr president , president barroso espouses a europe of ambition .
national sovereignty is the bedrock of our values and the cornerstone of the united kingdom's democracy .
in the eu , human rights whether individual or collective take second place to solidarity for europeans .
we in ukip prefer sovereignty to solidarity .
what kind of rights are these , when they are rejected out of hand in the name of solidarity ?
ukip places sovereignty and the citizen's rights above solidarity .
we reject the lisbon treaty and president barroso's vision of it .
what percentage of the votes would you receive ?
what would the citizens do ?
they would probably have listened to you today and seen that you promised everything to everyone .
hopefully , they would also find out what you did five years ago .
that was when you promised most people a very great deal .
i believe that is very , very little .
i want to make that quite clear .
in our opinion , the last five years have brought high points and low points .
the citizens must lend their support to europe .
fourthly and finally , we want a fundamentally new version of the interinstitutional agreements .
under these conditions , the five year period of office will be a positive one .
it would be as simple as that , if it were not much more complicated .
why do we feel somehow embarrassed and divided , however , when asked to support your candidacy ?
let us be frank .
consequently , our european citizens not only lost trust in the european institutions but also their hopes and passions .
in complete fairness , we must also admit that you cannot be held solely responsible for that .
the fact is that the union requires a larger budget and a budgetary policy crafted to promote economic recovery .
we must resource the budget by means of an independent and more progressive and transparent system .
that is not acceptable .
secondly , the vote now is different to the last time .
mr kelly , I am sorry but this is a new procedure but we have to apply it correctly .
it applies only to questions to the previous speaker , not for statements .
apologies for cutting you off .
the implementation and interpretation issues that have created uncertainty are the problem .
in any case , I have said that , if necessary , we can look at revising the directive .
you must be aware that the problems you raised do not arise in all member states .
on public services , mr hughes asked why the commission has not yet proposed a framework directive .
on the contrary , I recognise them .
on gender balance , I am committed to this and my commission has a record number of women .
as you know , the initiative on that comes from the member states .
i am committed to doing my best once again .
i remember the first delors commission had no women and the second had only one .
at one time I had nine women members of the commission , which I believe is very important .
regarding the issue of social matters , let us put this bluntly .
let us be honest about it .
i made that proposal .
so I completely disagree .
it is not intellectually honest to attack the commission all the time .
you are missing the target .
it is easier for you , but the reality is that we are pushing hard .
i am committed to social cohesion .
i agree with what mr lambsdorff said before .
that is your choice , not mine .
i want to bring the broadest possible consensus and exclude nobody .
we need a strong europe , but there is a contradiction there .
we are going to reduce your influence .
we are going to weaken you in front of the member states.
there is a contradiction there , so let us be honest about it .
today I have added some complements and clarifications , but it is the same programme .
europe cannot work on fanaticism , or on dogmatism .
no party has a majority alone , so we have to build a consensus in europe .
building this consensus in europe is critically important .
i am committed to that .
are you ?
that is my question .
it is a political issue .
you do not have a project for transforming europe environmentally and socially .
and yet that is , I believe , what needs to be done today .
the situation is clear .
between 2002 and 2006 , 728 people were transferred to guantánamo via portuguese airspace .
you were minister from 2002 to 200the next decade will decide where europe is going to be .
the current leading generation in western europe had a holiday from history .
we grew up in peace .
we grew up in a welfare state .
but history is knocking on our door .
unfortunately , europe does not have a culture of achievement .
the european dream is to retire to the french riviera as soon as possible .
may I give you one piece of advice keep europe focused on its core task .
remain open minded and do not propose a european tax because it will provoke a pitchfork revolution against europe .
i have never seen a demonstration in favour of a european tax .
it is simply a bridge too far and you will only feed public anger .
we know also that he is the lowest common denominator among the governments of the member states .
mr barroso will , of course , stand as a candidate without opposition , without an alternative .
when it comes down to it , we all have very little influence .
you know , president barroso , that this house is very much attached to this issue .
the measures taken are not fulfilling all expectations and are still not satisfactory .
in this expectation , we support your candidature and keep our fingers crossed for your presidency .
why do you not use plain language ?
now I hear you trying to sound as if you have complied with this request .
you have been asked about this before and you have been evasive every time .
sv mr president , europe today is a continent defined by peace and democracy .
this was not the case 70 years ago when europe was at war .
this was not the case 20 years ago , either , when europe was divided into east and west .
our generation has a responsibility to manage our continent and preserve and strengthen an open and democratic europe .
mr barroso , you have a special responsibility .
we need a leadership that listens .
you need to do more in this regard .
here are some guiding principles for the continuation of your work .
protectionism is an abomination even for a former maoist .
the strength of the eu lies in its open borders and free trade .
human rights apply to everyone , wherever they are .
you need to do more in this regard .
free europe's farmers and give consumers and the market a chance .
the eu does not need more institutional power struggles .
preserve us from that fate !
mr barroso , tomorrow , you will hopefully have the opportunity to establish a new commission .
i hope that you will then ensure that there are as many women as men in the new commission .
i shall focus on the meaning of flexicurity , which you often use to combine flexibility and security .
this concept appears to harbour serious dangers in terms of worker protection .
part time employment , for example , is fine when it is the worker's choice .
please god .
that is why I am calling on my fellow socialist members to show the same courage .
in the past , far right extremists concealed their faces under various different masks and guises .
today they parade through public squares and speak openly to the media .
are you that leader , mr barroso ?
so , mr barroso , the ball is in your court .
will you meet the challenge ?
because you have not convinced me yet .
nl madam president . mr barroso , when the credit crunch broke , you did nothing .
this is peanuts compared to the eur 30 35 billion europe ought to be providing .
in so doing , you are severely hampering copenhagen's chances of success .
there is the credit crunch , the economic crisis , the climate crisis three tests of genuine leadership .
mr barroso , three times you have failed to make the grade .
many I agree with .
however , you have taken a great interest in my constituency of northern ireland .
for this commitment I thank you .
we value the support and close working relationship of commission officials at all levels with northern ireland .
i look forward to this relationship continuing and my constituency benefiting from it .
you will know about the huge potential for the economy through the development of tourism .
as many in this chamber have said already today , it is actions and delivery that count .
es madam president , commission president , I want to make a preliminary comment .
we should not do things any differently from what happens in the national parliaments in this respect .
this is a strictly democratic principle .
we are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis , but also a crisis of values .
this is the first time that I have heard in this house any confirmation of these characteristics .
we are not only experiencing a crisis , but also a changing world .
the second point , which I also support , is mr barroso's european ambition .
the crisis is not yet over and its landscape is still unrecognisable .
it is also forcing us to deal with social inequalities in the european union .
we therefore need the political ambition that you have shown this afternoon , mr barroso .
we need a europe capable of regulating markets and guaranteeing rights , particularly social rights .
i have listened to the proposal to include a security related immigration commissioner in your commission .
we need strong institutions .
this is why we hope that the treaty of lisbon will be ratified .
it is a tool box that will make the institutions work .
we need a strong commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible .
the third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you .
our view remains strongly negative .
throughout the years of your presidency , the commission has shown itself to be incapable and lacking in autonomy .
it is obvious that we cannot identify with this majority .
in this respect , an important role will be played by the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators .
energy security also depends on the eu's neighbours .
we must support neighbouring countries which subscribe to european values and aspire to become part of the european family .
you show contempt for the mepsmemory of events .
for this we need an industrial policy to be adopted .
the citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis .
neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for europe will they find this impetus today .
to carry on as before is disastrous , said the philosopher , walter benjamin .
this is not only because we are convinced of your qualities but also because we are in a hurry .
another matter concerns europe's citizens .
today , this afternoon , the word has come up perhaps two or three times .
that is not enough .
finally , over the last six weeks , you have struck me as a man with passion and enthusiasm .
you thrive when challenged .
earlier , you referred to union membership and the right to strike as sacred .
the problems lie in implementation and interpretation by the european court of justice ecj .
what guarantees can you give us that this will be the case ?
institutionally speaking , we are on the way from nice to lisbon .
whether these are dangers or opportunities depends to a great extent on ourselves .
we must give josé manuel barroso our trust .
if you do not want mr barroso , who do you want ?
our support is not , therefore , a blank cheque , but an investment .
you can count on the vote of the portuguese socialists .
i wish you good luck and success in your work .
it is , in fact , about taking responsibility for europe .
i would like to highlight one point .
mr barroso , I am very grateful to you for mentioning this again in your interruption .
in this area , we are faced with several new challenges .
mr barroso , at what stage are the preparations for this institution ?
when will the institution begin its work ?
can we expect concrete and effective measures from the commission ?
my fourth question is as a candidate for president , do you intend to establish a mediation mechanism ?
mt madam president , mr barroso , financial and economic challenges have been extensively discussed .
today , however , I would like to focus on citizensrights and on the citizen's europe .
all of the above affect the european citizen , as do economic and financial issues .
we had the tampere programme , the hague programme , and now that of stockholm .
i believe that we must invest renewed energy in this field .
the stockholm programme will open up new opportunities .
are you satisfied with your achievements over the past five years ?
can you tell us today whether you are going to do things differently in your second term ?
are we going to see more of the same , or something new ?
what do you think you need to change about the way in which you go about your work ?
you clearly want to lead the commission of a european union that numbers 500 million people .
what additional efforts will your commission make in order to speed up this process ?
of course , we all have different views on that .
that is how democracy works , and that is how we work .
we are confident not only in you , but also in this parliament .
madam president , this vote tomorrow is very much a vote about the standing of the european parliament .
good luck tomorrow .
the geopolitical framework has undergone radical change .
it represents the genuine integration of different roots and cultures .
the committee on petitions is the first point of contact between the european institutions and citizens .
you have already announced the creation of two new commissioner posts .
i applaud your ambition to have a conquering , united and protective europe , as we want .
however , I question the european union's financial standing as regards all of your projects .
the union must have the financial resources for its ambitions .
some of my fellow members have already stressed this point .
it is true that the crisis is putting the member statesbudgets under pressure at the moment .
i know that you are conscious of this need , as you addressed it in your programme .
we call upon you to take the lead in the further liberalisation of the european services market .
i would like to thank the european commission for working with us .
the european single currency has proved its stabilising role in these crisis conditions .
i wish you success in the vote tomorrow .
in order to build this political europe , mr barroso , two pitfalls must be avoided in our view .
firstly , that of presenting competition as an absolute and insurmountable dogma .
the second pitfall to avoid is that of turning this commission into a mere general secretariat of the council .
in the future , it is our task to build europe together .
i am counting on you just as you can count on me .
pl madam president , europe is united .
it is a europe of peace , freedom and democracy .
however , europe is also diversified .
the common agricultural policy actually sanctions two europes the old and the new .
this requires changes and the creation of a genuine , unified , united and cohesive europe .
you , mr president , know this best of all .
what action do you intend to take in this area , in order to change this situation ?
it is easy to criticise but we have to give credit where credit is due .
leading 27 different countries in a pluralist europe is a challenging task and you have done it well .
what you have accomplished in five years speaks for itself .
i wish you every success .
you do not say where they should come from .
unfortunately I did not get an answer from you hopefully I will now .
my question is what about a financial transaction tax ?
even mr sarkozy has now proposed this , and mr steinmeier and others are talking about it now .
i have one specific comment we know mr barroso's position on the modified policies .
we have not seen his position on modified products .
does that mean the importation and marketing of contaminated products is to be tolerated in europe ?
madam president , I would first of all like to wish mr barroso well for tomorrow in the vote .
i know it is difficult to try and pinpoint any one individual state .
in this respect , I call for this temporary support to become permanent support .
in this respect , we are facing a serious problem with the environment .
they are now asking for money to overcome the situation which we have caused .
this is absurd and truly difficult to justify democratically .
we cannot make these mistakes with people's money .
we therefore call for the common fisheries policy to be revised , specifically based on these new principles .
i believe he is the right person for the job and his track record has been impressive .
i also believe that the eu will operate more effectively if the lisbon treaty is passed in my country .
those opposing the treaty in ireland are spreading scurrilous information about the minimum wage to be eur 1.8people speak of green shoots as part of the economic recovery in europe .
the ratification of the lisbon treaty is a green shoot in itself .
the investment community and people who create jobs want the lisbon treaty enacted .
these guarantees are important to us .
protocols are the same as the treaty and , of course , ireland needs europe europe needs ireland .
ga I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow .
de madam president , the european union is suffering from a dramatic democratic deficit .
unfortunately nothing has changed in this respect during the last five years under the leadership of mr barroso .
for this reason , I will be voting you out of office .
hu thank you for this opportunity to speak .
i would like to ask president barroso two questions .
madam president , I would like to begin with a procedural issue .
it is as simple as that .
i went there for a democratic debate .
i like democratic debate .
let us be clear on that .
i shall try to respond quickly to a large number of questions .
i will begin with the issue of bonuses , which was the last question .
unfortunately , at that time , no one paid attention to our recommendation .
many questions focused on energy security those of mr saryusz wolski , mr marinescu and others .
i personally am very committed to these issues .
you can count on me at the commission to be uncompromising in my defence of the european interest .
the 21st century could well be europe's century .
i believe that .
i believe that we can manage this globalisation not by force but with inspiration .
europe is the world's biggest export power .
it is the americans who are now taking inspiration from the european model .
what are the chinese doing ?
what are the americans and other major powers doing today ?
they are starting to talk to us about combating climate change .
as you can see , I cannot be as pessimistic as some of those who have spoken here today .
you all know where this crisis came from .
immediately after , we reacted .
it was europe that instigated this response .
that is the european position .
i believe in fact that we should be proud of the proposals we have made .
they are on the table .
on the subject of the environment , I believe that this commission's track record is well known .
someone said that biodiversity is not in there .
re read my document and you will see that it is in there .
i believe that we have some good credentials there .
that , once again , is what makes europe .
someone spoke of guantánamo .
i myself do not need advice from anyone on this issue .
therefore I do not need anyone's advice on how to show commitment to fundamental rights .
thank you , anyway .
that is obvious .
we have an unemployment problem that is much greater than before .
the lisbon strategy , which some criticise , was actually heading in the right direction , overall .
there was job creation and growth in europe .
it is the global financial crisis that has put us in a different position .
that is why I have called for a new social ambition .
mrs int veld told me that I had not convinced her .
you are very difficult to convince , mrs int veld .
i believe , in fact , that we can find a fundamental line of agreement on this .
i believe that we need an industrial base in europe .
i believe that we have the means to achieve this .
that would cause divisions .
we are world leaders when it comes to financial services .
what is the point of handing over the leadership to dubai ?
i do not see what the point would be .
let us be clear on that .
to conclude , I would like to say something very important to you .
some have said why should we elect you ?
you are the only candidate .
is that democratic ? 
i myself have very often wondered why I am the only candidate .
i lose to an ideal candidate from each group .
yet europe is not built with ideal candidates .
europe is an exercise in responsibility .
that is the reason .
europe is very diverse .
that said , I am no one's secretary general , and the commission is an independent institution .
i can assure you of that .
i am grateful to all those who have supported me I cannot name them all .
some of them are still here .
i am grateful to you .
your support is not a blank cheque .
i think highly of parliament .
some say you are too close to the governments.
i was elected for the first time to the portuguese parliament when I was 29 years old .
i am a politician I am not a technocrat or a bureaucrat .
i defend parliaments and I want to engage with you in this debate .
therefore , your demands can help me and can help the commission to do better .
this is what I shall aim to do if I have your support .
i would like to thank the president designate of the european commission .
i would also like to thank mrs malmström for being with us in this session .
please remember that the president designate has told us about the directions of political action for the next five years .
he has done this here , in parliament , where he has met with all the political groups .
he has given us information which is very important , both for us and for our citizens .
we will vote tomorrow , after today's long , exhaustive and wise discussion .
the president continued in english 
thank you very much once again , mr president designate .
for this reason I support mr barroso's candidacy , but this support is not a blank cheque .
i hope the second barroso commission can combine technical competence with thatsomething extra.
let us go the right way .
that , however , is not and never has been the only possible direction .
the alternative to that direction is that of a social europe , the europe of workers and peoples .
the next item is question time b7 0203 / 2009 .
the following questions are addressed to the commission .
subject protection of the textile and clothing industries in the context of international trade
the textile and clothing sector comes from decades of managed trade .
since early 2009 , trade in this sector has been fully liberalised .
the sector has reduced mass production and concentrated on products with higher value added and technological content .
today european textiles are known in the world for their innovation and technical performance .
the sector has been evolving successfully and has maintained a world class export performance .
there are also great concerns across europe .
in some municipalities , commissioner , it is now over 20 % , particularly in the north of portugal .
there are municipalities with textile mills where unemployment is over 20 % !
we are afraid that this situation may get worse , in a country where there is already considerable poverty .
i therefore ask you what specifically is going to be done .
member of the commission . I understand very well the strength of feeling .
that is precisely what we are seeking to do .
subject eu priorities for intergovernmental conference on climate change
i would , however , like to say a few more words .
this falls short of the 25 40 % reduction required by science .
we welcome the fact that japan will strengthen its target .
the eu has offered to take up a 30 % reduction target if others make comparable commitments .
these plans would then form the basis for targeted financial and other support .
adequate international financing will be essential to reach an effective agreement in copenhagen .
mr president , I would like to thank commissioner dimas for his answer .
but the discussions in the united states are ongoing .
we always take account of these important issues .
many studies have been carried out not only by the commission but also by industry and by various sectors .
subject measures to stimulate investment in increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies
the european environment agency recently presented provisional statistics for the year 2008 concerning the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions .
we must come up with specific solutions for specific situations .
a series of research and development endeavours based on the research and technological development framework programme 
subject development assistance in an economic crisis
i am referring above all to the very poor countries of the third world .
would it be possible to increase the aid for developing countries ?
my question is essentially whether it is possible to simplify the procedure for allowing this assistance to be increased .
concrete actions and procedures have already been put in place to speed up delivery of aid .
as the v flex utilises previously unallocated reserve funds , it represents additional financing for these highly vulnerable countries .
nevertheless , it is important to recall that development policy is a shared competence within the eu .
the prime responsibility for delivering on the oda commitments lies with the member states themselves .
in this regard , we very publicly monitor member state oda through our annual monterrey survey .
pl thank you for your explanation .
should the eu not be more active at international level ?
how can we eliminate tax irregularities and the illegal transfer of profits out of poor countries by various firms ?
finally , how can we fairly liberalise commercial exchange to benefit those who deserve help ?
subject demographics and development policy in africa
indeed , its fertility rate is expected to decline even below 2.5 % by 20the strategy has extended the concept of family planning to that of sexual and reproductive health and rights .
in particular , the education of women has an impact on their reproductive behaviour .
in order to address environmental pressure , it is of key importance to ensure that local livelihoods are sustainable .
our preparations for the copenhagen climate change summit are to be seen in this light .
it promotes important initiatives to enhance forest governance , especially through forest law enforcement , governance and trade .
however , in developing countries this demographic increase is particularly large , with social and economic consequences too .
the problem of overpopulation in africa is clearly limited to individual countries .
to what extent are these facts influencing the development policy of the european union ?
a lot of maternal deaths result from abortions in unacceptable circumstances .
in countries where the legislation allows abortion , the commission will also support these programmes .
so whether or not we take such measures really depends on the countries concerned .
this is not a new phenomenon .
we have seen it in all countries all over the globe .
this is not limited , as the honourable member is suggesting , to some countries .
it is rather a phenomenon that is linked to the development of the country concerned .
we are therefore following the situation in colombia very closely .
serious concerns remain concerning the effective application of the ilo core conventions in the country .
we are also proposing monitoring by civil society institutions on the implementation of labour laws .
twenty seven trade unionists have been murdered since the beginning of january 200i am very pleased that mr higgins has asked his question .
i am not convinced that suspending negotiations will achieve what both honourable members would wish to achieve .
that is the approach that I have taken .
subject international trade recovery
can the commission provide the following information 
what trade funding initiatives has it taken ?
we furthermore agree to temporary relaxation of the oecd rules on medium to long term credit insurance .
i have read the legislation forbuy american.
buy chineseis a different proposition .
in the absence of mr moraes , I am afraid question 27 falls .
subject marketing european beef and lamb products
the specificity of this strategy is that it is done through the right mix of various trade policy instruments .
can I ask the commissioner if she would consider a thorough and full examination of the food promotion budget ?
it has been in operation since the 1970s , is very restrictive and needs to be reformed .
it is well known that european beef and lamb products comply with the highest standards .
indeed , it is an area where we have increasingly to look and focus .
subject environmental damage caused by lignite mining in the czech republic and central germany
these units have to provide a financial guarantee to cover the cost of rehabilitation of the land .
the directive has applied to new facilities since may 200facilities which already existed must obtain authorisation , in accordance with the directive , by may 20 de thank you for your accurate and comprehensive answer .
there are many of these cases in these areas .
consequently , there is also money from this source .
provision is made for this type of support to continue in the relevant programming documents for the 2007 2013 period .

g20 summit in pittsburgh 24 25 september debate 
mr president , it is a great pleasure for me to be here today representing the swedish presidency .
the presidency and the commission will jointly represent the eu at the g20 summit in pittsburgh on 24 25 september .
we will hold an informal european council in brussels tomorrow to prepare the eu's common position .
as you will all be aware , the global financial crisis has necessitated unprecedented global measures 
firstly , rapid and forceful financial and monetary policy measures to support the financial sector and the real economy .
the overall support to the eu economy this year and next year is estimated at 5 % of gdp .
the central banks have responded to the crisis by keeping interest rates close to zero .
we are very aware that rising unemployment will be a very dominant issue in the time ahead .
the situation remains uncertain , but it could have been much worse .
the g20 has played , and will continue to play , a central part in this .
the g20 process has had the following significant results 
firstly , that we have a common analysis of the problems that have affected our economies .
furthermore , we have ensured that the international monetary fund has sufficient resources to meet demand for borrowing .
our coordinated eu strategy means that europe is leading the debate , rather than following it .
it is our solutions that are being noted when global solutions are drawn up .
that is why the presidency is inviting the heads of state or government to a dinner tomorrow evening .
we have only just begun to reflect on these exit strategies .
employment is another major challenge .
extensive work will continue to be required both at national and eu level .
this is a very high priority for the swedish presidency .
our goal is for the pittsburgh summit to make progress on guidelines for financing global climate measures .
i want to start by congratulating all of you on your election , or re election in many cases .
the european union has played an active and decisive role in encouraging the g20 in this respect .
all europeans , as well as the european institutions , should feel satisfied about all this .
the new us administration has also adopted a very significant stimulus plan .
for the first time in two years , these forecasts have not revised the previous forecast downwards .
i will come back to this briefly at the end of my speech .
this has involved intensive regulatory work over the last year .
some of these proposals have already been adopted here in this parliament and by the council .
it must be said that the european union is totally united on this point .
all that is already in hand .
emerging and developing countries quite rightly aspire to a more appropriate representation .
this is an aspiration that the european union supports , but it must be translated into concrete agreements .
as you know , the commission adopted a communication on the financing of climate change last week .
mr president , minister malmström , commissioner almunia , we are in a global crisis .
it is a summit where decisions have to be taken .
this relates to structural reformation in risk management , more transparency and better rules for financial supervision .
commissioner almunia , you said that there are proposals in place for hedge funds .
what do you hope to achieve in this regard at the g20 summit ?
you must therefore be bold .
that is the most important message this parliament can give the pittsburgh delegates .
be bold !
now you need to start putting it into practice .
it is good to start with the bonus systems , but it is not enough .
that is the most important task that we must now set ourselves .
nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy it is not prohibited .
a global transaction tax which benefits long term investors would take us forward in this discussion as a whole .
we want a number of the g20's elements and commitments to be formalised .
i think that your country , mrs malmström , sweden , has unfortunately also had experience of this .
please help us to take advantage of this experience .
for me , there are three essential tasks .
we cannot get out of this on our own .
europe must hammer home this message tirelessly .
in this respect , we should be wary of the g20's publicity stunts .
ultimately , we want more european entities .
i have several concerns .
the first is that the committee on development in this house drafted a motion for a resolution .
unfortunately , this motion was not passed , although it was written together by all groups of this house .
the second question is about tax havens .
the g20 wants to tackle it on the basis of case by case information exchange .
we know that this will not work .
we suggest introducing automatic information exchange so that information really flows between the different countries .
a global financial system needs transparency .
in portugal , bank profits grew by 18 % in the first quarter of this year .
the only thing that rose more than bank profits was unemployment .
they should do anything that can be seen if they want people to believe in them .
the money in our economy has been gifted to those responsible for the financial bubble .
the reality is that high finance gives the orders and politics obeys them .
in the united states as in europe , politicians appear merely as servants of the global banking power .
de mr president , we need democratic revolution .
it is good that there has been progress here .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the statistics are improving .
for that , political will , decisiveness and courage must not fail us on the contrary .
today we are talking about the gthe de larosière report is too little .
as far as I am concerned , the debate on pro cyclicity is too brief at the moment .
we need to remove the procyclic effects of the crisis and the current regulations for 2009 and 20the political will must not fail us .
i have four observations on this matter .
we have seen that there was significant support to fulfil this objective .
my second observation is that we must not fall for gimmicks .
a great deal has happened .
the fire appears to have been put out , but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky .
the citizens are unsettled .
financial ethics and responsibility appear , as ever , to be foreign words to many of them .
i am expecting specific and fast measures from the gi hope that the eu member states will all pull together .
mr president , so far the g20 has concentrated on measures for the financial sector .
i have deep respect for small enterprises which , against all odds , try to survive .
they deserve to get the loans to which they are entitled .
within the eu , we have to look again at the statute for a european company .
please do not fail to represent at the g20 summit the views of the majority of europe .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , who should regulate whom and how ?
that will be one of the controversial questions at the g20 summit .
there will be arguments over bonuses and there will be arguments over europe's demand for a tobin tax .
however , global economic recovery is also on the agenda .
it will be necessary to abide by the stability and growth pact in europe , not to bury it .
we must also take employment into consideration .
these are the people's real needs .
fr mr president , commissioner , I welcome your determination .
europe has begun to put in place effective regulation , but europe must not find itself isolated .
close international cooperation is necessary , and this is exactly what we expect of the git must pursue the reforms , which were initiated at previous meetings , with rigour and vigour .
guiding principles must be affirmed .
the crisis is not over .
the strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary .
the obligations for supervision should reflect the level of systematic risk that the financial institutions impose on this sector .
furthermore , commissioner , minister , please do not forget in pittsburgh that europe exists .
please make your voices heard above those of the three tenors .
i have here the letter of 3 september from the three european prime ministers .
there is not one word on europe .
you must speak louder than them .
i agree that it is important to regulate bonuses and tax havens .
these are all necessary , but inadequate , measures .
it is more important to make an effort in terms of supervision .
we also need to do something about trade .
mr president , I thank the commissioner .
i especially agree with him on his charter for sustainable economic activity .
i think this is a distraction in many ways although it should be dealt with .
neither is a wish list for solving the world's problems frankly likely to win the day .
the financial services industry is on fire .
we need first to make sure that we have put out that fire and that it stays out .
for this we need a consistent approach .
the financial system must once again serve the real economy and not continue to destroy it .
our southern partners , quite rightly , will not accept that their concerns continue to remain unanswered .
es mrs malmström , mr almunia , I will give you three ideas in one minute .
firstly , we need more europe .
this is because , given the global situation , europe must be united and strong .
if we fail to achieve this , europe will not count and will not be involved .
secondly , we need more state .
this , in my opinion , is an urgent issue for the future .
finally , we need a better market .
i believe this is essential .
on thursday , the 27 members of the council will meet to prepare for the gwhen it is a matter of state aid , breaches absolutely must be punished .
it is therefore essential that concrete and , above all , joint measures be adopted at pittsburgh .
fr mr president , you spoke of the governance of the imf .
what is your position on this ?
my third question is the g20 is also part of the preparations for copenhagen .
what is the council's position ?
what sum will you put on the table at the g20 next week ?
our national politicians are saying one thing , but here in the eu we seem to be doing another .
our economies are still very fragile .
unemployment is rising , and access to finance is a huge concern , especially for small and medium sized businesses .
do we want our british or european businesses to be at a competitive disadvantage when they need working capital ?
i firmly believe that we must take action against such trends .
we should subject the banks and other financial market operators to proper supervision .
we should prevent the continuation of the damaging bonus culture prevalent before the crisis .
we must work together on sensible rules to win over our g20 partners .
they are completely at the mercy of the banks , which do not provide sufficient reliable information .
a code of ethics has been drawn up in hungary .
this is an extremely important task for europe .
do you not think we should tackle this issue ?
mr president , I would like to thank all the members who have contributed to this debate .
many members have raised the issues that both I and the commissioner have looked at .
we hope that a supervisory system can be put in place as soon as possible .
we will base this on the larosière report and see how quickly we can get it into place .
we need more coordinated global solutions and effective and functioning international institutions .
we need clear principles for bonus systems .
we would also like to take up the matter of climate financing .
naturally , we will work towards this , because it would be a good thing .
we also need global solutions .
unemployment is perhaps the most noticeable aspect of the economic and financial crisis to the people of europe .
we will be having a special discussion on unemployment at ecofin in october .
we also have to discuss exit strategies .
it is always the most vulnerable in our society who suffer first .
it is hitting the poorest in the world hard .
we have discussed and are continuing to discuss how we can ease the situation of these people .
as a result , they would only be counterproductive and would not help our economies .
many members have raised the matter of hedge funds and new financial regulation .
in summary , naturally the g20 summit cannot solve all the problems that we have discussed .
thank you very much for a highly interesting debate .
this is a very important issue , which must be clarified by the pittsburgh summit .
i believe that this commitment has been made very clear at previous summits .
however , without a functioning financial system , nothing else can be sustained .
finally , I should like to comment on an issue that was raised in many of your speeches .
it is therefore true that not everything has been solved in these six months .
this clearly shows that more effective results can be achieved when there is true coordination .
it is expected that the approaching g20 summit will place a predominant emphasis on the copenhagen climate talks .
allow me to express a few thoughts I have on this subject .
number one . instead of vague long term promises , we need binding medium term undertakings .
these undertakings must be realistic , fair and accountable .
a specific financial pledge is needed to achieve this .
number three . flexibility mechanisms must continue to be given an important role .
number four . market based instruments must be given more scope in the post kyoto system .
at present , four of them have already achieved this .
the economic downturn has fuelled protectionist ambitions , which threatens to undermine the operation of the single market .
mr president , the market economy is a good slave but a bad master .
recently , though , the roles have become rather confused .
it is the custom at international conferences to speak trivia , but now we need action , and fast .
the global economy is in need of complete renovation and the keyword is transparency .
we have to try and do away with the risk economy and move towards the real economy .
in future , the taxpayer should not be made to pay for the damage .
i think , however , that we should at least look into how relevant they might be .
this is the background against which world leaders should operate .
the repercussions of the crisis have been felt by the inhabitants of almost every part of the globe .
that is why europe should speak with one voice at the summit .
the collapse is regarded as having actually precipitated the current deep global recession and the financial crisis .
there have already been steps taken in this direction .
the key phrase here isglobal approach.
in writing . I agree with those who spoke about the need for a global co ordinated approach .
this is essential if we are to change the power structures of the global financial system .
this week marks the anniversary of the collapse of lehman brothers .
it is estimated that it will take ten years for the investment bank to be wound up .
transparency is essential if we are to bring consumer confidence back to the banking sector .
swift debate 
the next item is the council statement on swift .
mr president , in the overall fight against terrorism , the key question is how are such activities financed .
in order to do this , we need international cooperation .
that is in everyone's interest .
this is indeed what will happen .
the presidency is convinced of the benefit of information from the tftp .
allow me to mention certain other provisions that we will demand are included in the agreement .
we have a common responsibility to ensure that the crime prevention authorities can counter terrorism effectively .
we also have a common responsibility to ensure that this takes place with legal certainty while respecting fundamental rights .
i believe that this meeting allowed a number of still open issues to be clarified .
i would like briefly to underline some aspects .
in short , mr bruguière said that the commitments have been honoured .
of course , we support the presidency wholeheartedly in its efforts to that end .
that is what I believe in all honesty .
firstly , there must be a balance between civil security and civil rights .
secondly , we need legal certainty for the companies concerned and for our citizens .
we wish you , mrs ask , and the commission , success here in the coming weeks .
these are our thoughts and we trust that they will meet with a broad consensus in plenary .
once the transitional agreement has been concluded , we will need to negotiate and conclude the final agreement quickly .
but there are some key questions left open .
to which judge can an eu citizen or an eu enterprise go in the case of criminal prosecution ?
mr president , after all these warm words , I am going to put a cat among the pigeons !
why not ?
it was known back in 2007 that the architecture of swift needed to be reformed .
why have you not consulted the national parliaments on the mandate ?
just come out and say it !
finally , let me deal with transparency .
that is real transparency .
in fact , however , fundamental rights are being eroded and proper public debate on them frustrated .
every effort is being made to exclude parliaments and hold back information .
this sort of untransparent approach is unacceptable for a democratic europe .
it is not enough to just tap at the door a responsible parliament must stop this undesirable development .
the presidency must interrupt negotiations until it can guarantee the rights of citizens and parliaments .
we greens will have nothing to do with this .
the scandal has made the european authorities sit up and take notice .
an agreement has been signed with the us government .
an expert has made an assessment of this agreement .
which expert , though ?
we propose amendments to reinforce the demands that the european parliament has a duty to make .
we must go further and call for the suspension of the agreement if the principles set out are infringed .
we are counting on the swedish presidency .
we will continually monitor respect for human rights .
mr president , thank you for these important points of view .
i will try to answer some of the questions in the short time available .
obviously , it is crucial that the information is reliable .
naturally , this restricts how the information can be used .
in order for this to happen , we need an agreement .
that is what we are negotiating and that is what we have been mandated by the council to do .
that is what I have attempted to describe .
i am entirely convinced that we will achieve this .
if contrary to expectation we do not , then there will be no agreement .
i believe that in this matter , the council has just made its will very clear .
mr president , I have a small point of order .
i note that once again we are not getting replies from the council to the questions that we put .
vote 17 september 2009 
eu strategy for the baltic sea area debate 
the next item is the council and commission statements on the eu strategy for the baltic sea area .
we can create new business opportunities and new jobs , and improve transport links .
consequently , it is important that regional strategies form part of a wider european policy .
getting to grips with the environmental issues is , of course , one of the main priorities .
this is a very sensitive marine environment that is exposed to various kinds of environmental impact .
decisive efforts are needed , and quickly .
the economic crisis has made the matter of jobs and growth highly topical .
most of the countries in the baltic sea area are small and are dependent on exports .
this means that we must increase integration in order to strengthen competitiveness throughout the entire baltic sea region .
our aims and goals in this respect are clear .
we must address the crisis by increasing cooperation and commitment in our immediate area .
global competitiveness requires cross border cooperation between countries and enterprises , in research and through innovations .
the aim of the strategy for the baltic sea area is not to create new institutions .
naturally , our objective cannot be achieved overnight , but our goals are ambitious .
the high visibility this provides for the strategy is extremely welcome .
in addition , the commission proposes to play the role of a facilitator in the case of difficulties .
responsibility must rest with the relevant member states and other stakeholders directly involved on the ground .
so what are the next steps ?
the commission very much expects parliament to be actively involved in events such as the annual forum .
this strategy reflects a fundamental change that took place in this region five years ago .
since 2004 , the baltic has become the eu's internal sea .
furthermore , the bss is an example of excellent cooperation between the main institutions of the eu .
i would also like to express my special gratitude to commission president barroso .
i would like to make three points .
the eu and member states have to agree on providing alternative channels for energy deliveries .
first and foremost , it comes down to creating a united energy system around the baltic sea .
however , some questions do still arise .
you just said that there are no additional funds .
if so , we need to ask which cohesion policy projects already approved will lose funding .
that would be very important to us .
the region's problems can best be solved through cooperation between its peoples , countries , organisations and businesses .
my group is especially pleased that sweden has highlighted the importance of countering the trade in humans and crime .
we now need a baltic sea action plan to end this .
agriculture is mainly responsible for that there is nitrogen and phosphorus runoff from eu fields .
nitrogen and phosphorus take oxygen from the seabed and feed poisonous algae at the surface .
the question of whether the baltic sea is to be cleaned is largely in the hands of the eu .
the commission recognises this in its strategy , but the proposals for measures are vague .
virtually the only precise measure is to prohibit the use of phosphates in detergents .
europe has already invested eur 200 million in the safety of this power plant .
to decommission it today , european states will have to contribute another eur 800 million .
is it right with respect to the citizens of lithuania and other states ?
money for the decommissioning of the reactor will have to be taken from people hit by the economic crisis .
no , this is wrong .
following this sacrifice , lithuania will find it considerably harder to overcome the economic crisis .
unemployment in the country will grow even more and poverty will increase .
ladies and gentlemen , tell me , does europe need such a sacrifice today ?
do we not have a better way to spend eur 800 million today ?
ladies and gentlemen , there are only 2563 hours and 58 minutes until the reactor is shut down .
sustainability must therefore be included right from the planning phase .
this is an area with 100 million inhabitants and an investment budget of eur 50 billion .
we need to proceed very carefully here if we are to make a success of this pilot project .
pl what a macroregion needs is a coordinated policy of sustainable development .
here I would like to underline the role the then commissioner mrs danuta hübner played in drafting this strategy .
this policy is now being continued by commissioner samecki , to whom I also extend my heartfelt congratulations .
the active participation of these organisations should be very useful in realising these strategies .
i would like to make four points , mr commissioner .
but this parliament remains ambitious , and I think this parliament does want to be involved .
a macro regional economic strategy could be the way forward in other ways , in other places , in europe .
let us hope that this one works well .
the baltic sea is suffering two major acute environmental problems .
the second problem is overfishing .
researchers are entirely unanimous on this .
the problem is that the baltic sea needs a healthy ecosystem .
we would also need to prohibit the dumping of cod and this should take effect immediately .
at present large volumes of young cod that have just arrived in the baltic sea are being dumped .
i call on the swedish presidency to take up my challenge and deal with this problem .
i can see savings in linking up local and regional bodies .
latvia , lithuania and estonia must be integrated into the common regional energy network , including nordel .
our second priority is further infrastructure development .
the development of transit corridors and communications networks will stimulate business and create new jobs .
an effective mechanism for implementing and monitoring the strategy is also important .
it has to be simple , transparent and free of superfluous bureaucracy .
regular reviews of the introduction of the strategy and interim reports are essential .
the first should already be produced in 20i welcome the swedish presidency's active role in getting the strategy going .
however , not all the recommendations of this house have been accepted by the commission .
the commission assures us that funding will come from existing instruments , primarily the structural funds .
last year , the european parliament took a negative stance on this .
mr president , it is indeed a unique european regional policy initiative and a pioneering project .
the process of the preparation of the strategy has led to a genuine partnership between all of them .
development challenges increasingly do not respect administrative or political borders .
fi mr president , the european union became aware of the baltic sea issue quite late on .
it is important that we take the strategy forward and thus also implement it .
during its presidency , sweden has also integrated these regional policy matters closely with this baltic sea strategy .
the baltic sea strategy must therefore be made part of the common european agenda .
some of the region's member states , including latvia , have been severely hit by the economic crisis .
our financial sector is interconnected with the scandinavian one .
this means that our problems will create problems there , so this is not a national issue .
recently , latvia received medium term financial assistance for balance of payments , provided for by the commission .
unfortunately , there are no social conditions for such assistance .
as a result , the government is reducing pensions and benefits , but the commission tolerates this .
my second concern is about fundamental rights .
without proper financing , however , the project will not succeed .
in that case , all this will end after the strategy has been adopted .
that is the least we must do .
the commissioner referred earlier to the flagship projects , 80 in total .
that raises the question of how we deal with offshore installations in the baltic sea .
that is why investments in treatment plants need to be promoted .
one hundred million people live in this region .
it is not intended that any new funds will be earmarked for the strategy .
however , there are plenty of resources in the region that we can use .
eur 55 million has been earmarked for the region under the existing budgetary framework .
one of these concerns trafficking an area mentioned by mrs jäätteenmäki .
mrs hassi and mrs lövin mentioned the matter of the marine environment , agriculture and fisheries .
there are a number of such projects here and I would very much like to see more of them .
there are also other partnerships in the baltic region .
naturally , this is something that the union will continue to work on .
the ignalina plant has nothing to do with the baltic sea strategy .
that was an old decision that already existed from the time of lithuania's accession negotiations .
naturally it is related to the baltic sea , but it is not part of the strategy .
the baltic sea strategy is an internal eu strategy .
it will be what we make it .
the danube region and the black sea region have been mentioned in this connection .
i believe that there is a great deal to do here and a great deal that can inspire us .
i will be unable to respond to all comments and issues raised in the debate or in your statements .
i would like just to refer to three broad groups of issues .
first , the shape .
however , it is to be agreed in the future work related to the implementation of the strategy .
second point on management and governance .
i think that we should not delude ourselves .
the responsibilities of member states , of the commission and of other organisations involved in the management .
of course we foresee reporting concerning progress made in relation to implementation to parliament .
several members mentioned the need for additional funds for new projects etc .
at present , we have more or less three options .
the objectives must be realised in practice the strategy must not just remain a fancy declaration .
in writing . the baltic sea strategy promoted by the swedish presidency is very welcome .
it could readily assume a model function for other european macroregions , like the danube basin .
there is , however , one aspect of the development of the baltic sea region that demands urgent reconsideration .
this is the nord stream sea bed pipeline between russia and germany .
chemical weapons were sunk here after world war ii in the late 1940s .
election of president of commission vote 
fr mr president .
the speaker was interrupted by heckling from the right 
are you ill or something ?
are you ill ?
as there were problems with the vote yesterday , I would ask you to check the machines .
it is not such a bad idea , is it , ladies and gentlemen ?
today's agenda includes electing the president of the european commission .
this election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution .
it is we , the elected representatives of all european regions , who will do this .
the council of europe has nominated josé manuel barroso as president of the commission .
the ballot is secret .
let us now proceed to elect the president of the commission in accordance with the rules of procedure .
the vote will be held using the electronic system .
i say this because there are many new meps in the house .
as usual , in the vote you may vote for or against the candidate , or abstain .
the vote is held 
i would like to say that we have plenty of work ahead of us .
mr president , I know that you are aware of the priorities of the european parliament .
for that reason , we greatly look forward to working with you over the coming five years .
we expect above all to be able to respond to our citizensneeds .
congratulations , and all the best !
please also allow me on this occasion to say a few words to my own country , portugal .
i have an official statement .
in view of the amount of work ahead of us , we should work as quickly as possible .
this was the official statement related to the election of mr barroso as president of the european commission .
appointments to interparliamentary delegations vote 
forest fires in the summer of 2009 vote 
today we are facing an unusually important , but also symbolic vote .
once every five years , the european parliament decides who will head another eu institution .
in 2008 , we waited in vain for president barroso to call for order .
this is why I am unable to support your candidacy .
it is difficult for those who have the floor to speak with this din all around .
the speaker continued in neapolitan 
i have no personal problems with josé manuel barroso .
now , of course , there is much doubt about whatsmart regulationmeans .
many people believe that smart regulation is bad regulation , or that any regulation is not very smart regulation .
we have going through this house next year the alternative investment fund management directive .
how , under those circumstances , are we going to get smart regulation ?
i ask mr barroso to reconsider .
i draw attention to paragraphs 3 , 7 and 8 of the joint motion for a resolution .
president barroso has made europe the world leader in the fight against climate change .
the challenges facing us are complex , and the responses must necessarily be holistic .
he did not measure up to the task when the financial , economic and social crisis occurred .
the european commission's policy needs to be reoriented .
mr barroso is not the man for the job .
we need a directive on public services and a reoriented policy by the commission on pay .
if we want to save our european social model , we need a much more ambitious social agenda .
i hope the second barroso commission can combine technical competence with thatsomething extra.
let us go the right way .
this value has been acknowledged by the european parliament in this vote .
over the last five years , dr barroso showed strong , comprehensive leadership .
the european parliament has just sent out a signal that europe is strong and has a strong leader .
therefore , with confidence and hope , we can advance towards a europe of greater prosperity and solidarity .
we would all like to see a stronger europe , and for people to be better off !
the text you sent us does not make this clear .
the question is , why not ?
today I voted against mr barroso's candidacy for three essential reasons .
josé manuel barroso has certainly not furthered a strong europe .
personally speaking , I regret and condemn the secret ballot procedure that leads to a complete lack of accountability .
he must not be in any way an advocate for national interests .
consequently , I chose not to vote for president barroso's reappointment .
i voted in favour of appointing mr barroso as president of the european commission .
i have come to this decision for four reasons .
the european council unanimously proposed mr barroso's candidacy .
in my understanding of democracy , election winners can claim the right to choose one of their own .
my support also comes with some expectations .
i would ask mr barroso to use his influence to counteract this evolution .
the failure of this strategy is clear .
its foreign policy programme makes no reference to the sahara or palestine .
like 381 of my fellow members , I supported mr barroso's appointment as head of the commission .
the europe of the 12 , of kohl and mitterrand , is no more and will doubtless never return .
i hope it will be so and I want to give him the credit for this .
to postpone this vote one more time would be to bark up the wrong tree .
to wait for a phantom candidate would be a mistake .
priorities must be defined pragmatically but without neglecting the values that lie at the origin of the european project .
big brother europe marches on , but apparently no one is to know , and that includes meps .
once again this summer , forest fires have devastated the south of france .
that is a fact that cannot be contradicted .
it does not , however , explain environmental disasters , especially if the same phenomena recur every few years .
we can and must be better prepared .
it really is time the member states of the union took a look in the mirror .
our political environment cannot be one where people close their eyes to the facts .
this benefits nobody , especially when it concerns the scale of the human tragedy resulting from forest fires .
the deforestation is partly due to the construction of roads and railway lines .
we must say straightaway that preventing natural disasters and adapting to climate change is not an easy task .
for me , two proposals seem essential to improve the situation .
firstly , mr barnier's report of 2006 on a european civil protection force must be implemented in full .
secondly , it is important for the commission to have a right to oversee what is happening locally .
i voted in favour of the resolution on forest fires .
that is more than in the whole of 2008 !
in poland , the coefficient of the threat of forest fires is one of the highest in europe .
in april 2009 , the number of fires was the highest in five years .
we need to set up a european reaction force capable of acting quickly in case of natural disasters .
this would be a financial and organisational completion of the actions undertaken in the member states .
in writing . today's debate on forest fires in welcomed .
the devastation to many sites of natural beauty is a loss to us all .
we must show solidarity with our colleagues and help the countries affected .
criminal behaviour should also be suitably punished at a national level .
i abstained from the final vote on the compromise resolution on the aftermath of the forest fires in 200corrections to votes and voting intentions see minutes
financial services signature of the acts 
before resuming the sitting , a legislative package will be signed to make it effective .
cecilia malmström , the minister for european affairs , will sign on behalf of the council .
i am very pleased that commissioner benita ferrero waldner is also with us today .
i have been asked to represent the european parliament at the dinner of heads of state or government .
we , the european union , will be preparing for our participation in the g20 summit in pittsburgh .
what is in the package ?
these acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets .
there is therefore still reason for parliament , the council and the commission to work closely with each other .
you will all be present at the signing , and the minister and I will sign .
we shall now proceed to the signing .

conclusion of a partnership and cooperation agreement between the ec and the republic of tajikistan debate 
12475 / 2004 11803 / 2004 c6 0118 / 2005 .
i know that parliament has a strong interest in this issue .
tajikistan is an important part of our overall strategy for central asia .
this hardly accessible country is one of the poorest in the world .
we are already doing this through a number of
now , let us take this as our starting point .
europe should have the courage to call a spade a spade .
unfortunately , however , the numbers refute this .
according to un figures , we have 270 000 victims in the european union .
unfortunately , numbers have been rising in recent years .								   
in fact , it is a definition of slavery .
trafficking is today's slavery .
extreme poverty , family breakdown and domestic violence contribute to some of the root causes of human trafficking .
in the uk , we estimate approximately 5 000 victims , of which 330 are children .
the ecr group welcomes this debate .
national governments , law enforcement agencies and border control agencies need to work together .
mechanisms for victim support need strengthening .
initiatives must be robust , member state driven and eu supported .
demand is a key word as regards the combating of trafficking in human beings .
we really owe it to all the victims .
i support the question and I would like to add a few factual observations and notes .
ordinary people usually have no idea of the enormous scale of trafficking in human beings .
as a matter of fact , it is the third most lucrative illicit trade in the world .
the fact that it mostly concerns women and children makes this immense business all the more inhumane .
the demand side deserves strict sanctions .
those who profit from exploitation of desperate or manipulated people within the grey economy must not go unpunished .
those who provide such services and those who use them consciously should also be faced with sanctions .
sv slavery has not yet been abolished , as many in this house have already emphasised .
this law is important , because through it , society signals that no human being is for sale .
it is time that it was consigned to the dark recesses of history .
it is also an internal problem .
citizens of my country are also being sold to at least several member states of the european union .
it is a very significant and serious problem .
this , too , is human trafficking , and we must not be silent about it .
studies have shown that the profits from trafficking in human beings exceed those from drug smuggling and dealing .
this kind of organised crime has grown with the union's enlargement to the east .
also missing is effective prevention and education focused on children and parents alike .
as many as 1 500 websites where children are sexually abused were discovered in 200consequently , we have to come down hard on those behind it .
the victims of human trafficking are the most vulnerable and defenceless people , and they need our protection .
we must not send them back into the arms of the human traffickers .
they must be offered residence permits .
it is also necessary to ensure the security of victims of trafficking in human beings and their complete integration .
the accomplices , organisers or sponsors of this terrible crime must not be allowed to avoid responsibility .
sk I would like to congratulate the authors of this question , mrs hedh and mrs bauer .
i am thinking of prostitution , first and foremost , but also of children .
very often , we do not want to see it .
in the uk , last year alone , 325 children were identified as being suspected victims of trafficking .
they find it just too easy to re traffic these children .
this occurs all over the eu and we must put a stop to it .
we are talking about hard to monitor criminal activity here , with a very high number of unreported cases .
sk I congratulate the authors on the submitted question and you , commissioner , on your response .
i would like to underline one of the many topics relating to this issue .
however , it fails to mention that parents should play a primary role in protecting children from trafficking .
this campaign should alert parents to the risks that their children face .
i firmly believe that we can protect children from trafficking only if we cooperate with parents .
unfortunately , parents are not mentioned anywhere in the draft resolution .
too few criminals are brought to justice .
the victims do not receive appropriate assistance , shelter or compensation .
thirdly , the situation is not being monitored sufficiently .
it is obvious that this problem does not affect only the european union .
i believe that it is not enough to simply refer to or reflect on this huge problem .
we therefore need great political will to tackle the problem .
here tonight , this great political will has been displayed , and how !
i believe we can also say that this is a problem that must be tackled from a european perspective .
it is happening in europe and we must tackle it from europe .
i believe that mrs roithová put it very succinctly in her speech .
the first is victim protection .
victim protection is a central aspect and certainly the one most discussed here tonight .
as you said , minister , political will does exist in the european parliament .
i believe the commission has already done some good preparation work on this draft directive .
once again , I would like to thank all the speakers .
the vote will take place at the february I part session .
often , it is children who are in the greatest danger .
according to the ilo , roughly 218 million children are involved in child labour at present .
the eu must urgently tackle trafficking in the labour market .
currently , the laws exist in most countries but are simply not being enforced .
i should mention that better funding is also required for the programmes intended to combat human trafficking .
it is very important to make a distinction between the two .
those affected by human trafficking have not taken a free , informed decision about all this .
they are to be treated entirely as victims .
eu member states must offer victims adequate protection .
in writing . women and children are the principal victims of human trafficking .
victim protection costs money , and this life saving money should be spent wisely .
what is clear is that the political will is not there .
apart from the political will not being there , the police will is not there either .
announcement by the president
it concerns the 18 additional members of the european parliament .
work on this will continue .
at all events , the european parliament is in full control of the situation .
there are no exceptional situations here , and we are acting in accordance with democratic procedures .
the permanent presidency of the european council will present the results of its work at european summits .
presentation of the programme of the spanish presidency debate 
the next item is the statement by the council on presentation of the programme of the spanish presidency .
both european society and , above all , our deep seated convictions , demand it .
europe was the dream of generations , of many generations of spaniards .
this is what we want to do during the next six months .
regarding the economic crisis , I would like to say the following .
the number of unemployed has increased by eight million , many of whom are indeed in my country .
we need to continue maintaining the fiscal stimuli until the recovery is a reality .
we need to commit ourselves to maintaining the stability pact and fulfil the commission's indications for 20we know what the european union's strengths and weaknesses are .
we do , however , also have strengths , and we should remember them .
we represent almost 60 % of global development aid , which is a great strength for the european union .
energy dependency has increased from 44 % to 53 % in the whole of the european union .
do you know what this amount represents ?
we need to change our energy dependency and reduce it , because otherwise , our economic fragility will increase .
progress has been made in the field of energy , but not the progress that we want .
the second main objective in a modern society , what brings the most growth and innovation ?
investment in the information society and in the new technologies that have changed almost everything in the world .
we want to take steps to establish a digital market .
what does this involve ?
the third area is the economy or sustainable industry .
we want to launch and promote , along with the commission , a plan to develop electric vehicles .
the vehicle industry is going to undergo a major transformation , which has already begun .
we need to conclude the bologna process .
we will be spectators , not leading players .
it strengthens parliament , the heart of european democracy , and also strengthens the commission .
that is how we shall work .
the matter of neighbourhood relations must be a priority .
the first of these is the people's legislative initiative , which is so important to parliament .
i hope that the vote will take place very soon .
the commission could mobilise a further eur 200 million in longer term aid .
haiti is a caribbean country .
i would particularly like to note that latin america and the caribbean are a priority for the spanish presidency .
let me now turn to the policy priorities for the weeks and months ahead .
everything points in the direction of determined and united european action .
only with a united europe can we shape globalisation .
but we have to look at the situation of our economy .
we all know that the european economy is at a delicate moment .
determined action has succeeded in preventing the worst .
at the same time , we must learn from the crisis .
we fully realised that globalisation is a reality and that we need to use it to our advantage .
now we have to shape the right future for europe , its economy and its society .
however , I am confident in the capacities of europe .
i believe that an economy rebuilding its strengths has a real chance to redirect its energies .
this will constitute theeurope 2020strategy .
we need a fundamental reworking of our economy to meet the challenges of the future .
europe 2020 must offer both a mid term vision and short term action .
we need to define together actions at european union level to complement national actions with positive social impact .
europe's huge industrial assets need to be re directed to seizing the first mover advantage in tomorrow's markets .
but europe must be able to retain a solid , modern and competitive industrial base .
the crisis means that , more than ever , we must use every euro of investment to best effect .
this also includes our sme friendly approach .
that is why I have discussed this with the council and with the president of the european council .
but , of course , this does not exhaust our agenda .
the challenges of the coming weeks and months are manifold .
the more we are united and effective at home , the more our case will win through internationally .
thank you , mr barroso .
it is a vision of development of the european union , based on the community method .
today , we are forecasting our role for many years to come .
not everything is found in the treaties .
i would like to thank mr barroso for presenting the point of view of the european commission .
now I would like to ask the leaders of the political groups for their comments and remarks .
it is , in fact , a matter of survival for europe and its social model .
mr rodríguez zapatero , you know what economic difficulties are .
they are the record unemployment of almost 20 % and a public deficit of almost 11 % in spain .
it has to be said , yours is a country that is experiencing problems .
the council and parliament must now work in close cooperation and as equals .
you have six months to establish this principle .
the best of luck to you .
that is the right approach and it will take europe into a new phase .
we have held many summits in the past .
the summits do not solve the problems , they delineate them .
what we need is for the solutions to the problems to actually be implemented in the member states .
the reactions to your proposal for economic governance indicate that this is exactly where the problem lies .
where did the lisbon strategy fail ?
it was not that it would not have been possible to implement it .
no , it was possible to implement it .
the lisbon strategy failed due to the reluctance of the member states to keep their own promises .
for this , we need new approaches and , therefore , you are on the right path .
what europe needs is to adopt some aspects of the spanish model .
you have our greatest respect for that .
i would therefore like to add that we also need more economic control in europe .
that is destroying people's trust in the economic system .
it is destroying social cohesion .
i believe that what you have presented here is an approach that brings genuine reason for hope .
so , I wish you good luck , mr zapatero .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we have , in fact , two priorities for the spanish presidency .
i believe you also have , in fact , two priorities .
first of all , there is the post lisbon eu 2020 strategy .
this is , therefore , already a major advance .
however we , in this house , have to be serious .
we all agree on this .
it is as if the union has become the oecd .
that is the reality publishing one document after another , after another .
things must change we need sticks , we need carrots .
where needed , we must have sanctions .
it must be a good omen , though !
it is either one thing or the other .
one cannot have it both ways .
we must acknowledge that our approach failed .
we must say it , we must recognise it .
no , it was not the right method .
the strategy was bad , because the result is bad .
therefore , the strategy has to change .
i myself suggest that we adopt a strategy based on three components .
that meant that there were at least eight european political leaders who wanted to negotiate .
there was not enough room around the table though !
there was scarcely room for mr obama even .
how do you expect to agree a position and be heard by others in such circumstances ?
let us do like the wto then it works for the wto .
moreover , we must , I believe , be realistic .
we must be realistic on this matter .
we need a trilateral agreement between the united states , europe and china .
that must be the aim .
tomorrow's world is one of empires , and we must be an empire .
this means that we must be at the table .
with whom ?
with the united states and with china .
at the end of the day , we have to create an alliance with the united states .
it is with the united states that we must find common ground .
such common ground can be found , in my view , in the emissions trading mechanism .
we have that , and they will follow us if we can reach an agreement on it .
that will give us common ground in order , together , to negotiate with the chinese .
mr rodríguez zapatero , mr barroso , I would like first to reply to your remark about haiti .
this was during mr barroso's commission .
if we had had europeaid today , europeans would already have a greater presence in haiti .
mr president , take up michel barnier's proposal .
you see , I am no sectarian .
i would like now to turn to what you said about europe's future .
i would like to continue with another theme , which mr verhofstadt discussed .
you talk of growth , but what growth ?
that is already one issue for consideration .
we in europe must develop a major pact for european investment in energy saving .
so do not forget renewables , yes , but renewables with energy savings .
we can do it , if we want to .
now to the second issue you spoke about electric cars .
very well !
however , there is another consideration .
mobility is not just about cars .
you had airbus , you have the tgvs .
why not develop a major european tramways project ?
in this way , you will be able to give it another mobility related function .
a european tramways project is also a solution to the climate problems linked to traffic .
on a different note , you rightly spoke of education and the bologna process .
fine !
the problem with the bologna process , though , is that it has been diverted from its original purpose .
curricula have been created that students are unable to follow .
i would like to end on your european social pact .
a european social pact and a social and environmental pact .
bring the companies , bring the unions and bring the major environmental associations around a table .
social protection will not work without environmental protection .
if you go down that path , we will be in agreement , and europe is the solution .
as for the instruments , we shall have to develop them together .
it stumbled in its first few days in office .
socialism does not do that .
i would like to touch on foreign policy .
that issue is iran .
its illegitimate , brutal and dangerous government must be dealt with firmly .
the spanish presidency takes office with a full agenda .
our group will judge its proposals and initiatives on their merits .
if it does that , then it will have our support .
welcome , mr rodríguez zapatero .
unfortunately , my group feels that your programme does not resolve the fundamental problems .
this is the actual reality .
on this specific point , there is no innovation .
on foreign policy , we do not agree that we need to increase military capacity .
the images of the disaster in haiti where combat helicopters and marines are being deployed are damaging to us .
they are damaging !
this is not what is needed when there are disasters such as the one in haiti .
we need civil protection .
we need doctors , architects and people to relieve the pain of the tragedy .
finally , mr zapatero , the summit with morocco .
we do not agree with this summit .
we believe that there should be a european summit regarding the right to self determination of the saharan people .
on behalf of the efd group . mr president , 
i will now refer to a reality .
as a national of spain , I am ashamed to see what is going on in my country .
the european union has been convincing its population that it is there to maintain peace in europe .
is this situation I describe going to bring peace to europe ?
you are telling us that you are going to get europe out of the crisis .
mr zapatero , we want a solution now .
those values are freedom , the rule of reason , laicism and solidarity .
i would also place more emphasis on defending human rights in the world .
without this , everything is held back and even international policy runs the risk of evaporating like smoke .
i will talk about the most important matters , starting with mr daul .
thank you for your words regarding this positive drive for economic governance , the common economic policy .
i would like to clarify something .
it has little to do with my speech , but a great deal to do with my political convictions .
i am a strong supporter of the stability pact .
i am a strong supporter of fiscal balance throughout the cycle .
i am therefore a convert .
deficit and surplus are tools , depending on the economic cycle .
this is not an ideological problem .
it is strict in terms of our public accounts , and we will put it into practice .
in fact , in my speech , I strongly advocated a common energy market and a european digital market .
this is something different .
spain has been a victim of this , as have some citizens , not only british citizens .
this is the will of the government , within its scope of competence .
i think this is an important matter .
that is my opinion .
mr schulz , thank you for your words .
mr verhofstadt , I am extremely grateful for your words .
i agree with practically everything you said .
with regard to coordination and the failure of lisbon , open coordination failed .
we are aware of this .
government requires a community method .
there are many decisions in the workings of the european union that involve sanctions .
also , it works .
i completely agree with what you proposed regarding copenhagen and the subsequent strategy , the new strategy .
it is true that europe held a positive position , but that was not the result .
mr meyer , with all due respect , there are some things that we do not agree on .
a progressive programme is one which sees changes , one which anticipates them and is capable of innovating .
i hope and trust that the european union will keep in step with this .
i respect your position on morocco , but I do not share it .
north africa , especially morocco , is of strategic importance to the european union .
for me personally , it is something worthy of  .
i have taken note of your suggestions , mrs andreasen .
in the whole of my speech , I talked about sustainable growth , environmentally sustainable growth .
it is for us to join forces .
joining forces does not mean controlling , uniting does not mean leading .
on the contrary , joining forces is more democratic , uniting promotes cooperation .
that is not what we are debating .
these are the objectives .
of course I completely agree I believe that the european union has a clear position regarding iran .
i share your concern and your feelings on this subject .
i fully agree with what you said about energy , which was largely the focus of my speech .
as we are well aware , energy has determined the course of history .
it has determined how certain powers have dominated other countries .
it does so where we feel that offering our hand is better than closing the door .
we will therefore maintain the summit with our neighbour , morocco .
we will , at all times , promote the defence of human rights .
i would like to express my respect for all their positions .
we do not have to go very far .
we received this report , which had my support and that of the then presidency of the council .
now , I believe that the answer lies in the treaty of lisbon .
that is all on the first question .
the second question concerns international negotiations , for example , in the wake of copenhagen .
it is henceforth the commission that represents the union in foreign affairs , not the european council .
without doubt , there will be heads of state or government who will represent their own countries .
who , though , represents the union in foreign affairs , except for the cfsp ?
the commission .
let us be clear on this point too .
the third question concerns economic policy .
here , too , the treaty of lisbon has to be read .
there are those who think that economic policy is a purely national matter .
that is not the case .
there is , therefore , joint monitoring .
comment made off microphone 
no , yes , of course , I have already done it .
i do not need to have your support to say it .
the spanish presidency has a great responsibility .
both the letter and the spirit of the treaty of lisbon are very clear .
a stronger europe !
thank you , mr barroso .
we have all read the treaty of lisbon , and we know it does not say everything .
therefore , the crisis of values has manifested itself before and also during the european integration project .
transitions are always an opportunity .
i am going to tell you how the spanish presidency should not be measured .
it is not going to be measured by the number of meetings that we hold .
the measure of a good presidency is not conventional speeches or great words , or common places .
this will be the only way that we will truly move closer to all europeans .
it is a crucial time owing to the entry into force , finally , of the treaty of lisbon .
those people are watching us , they have expectations of us and they are demanding answers from us .
the crisis necessitates global thinking and local action , but you need to join forces with everyone .
include the regions , build decision making processes with them .
this also means applying the treaty of lisbon , which gives them a role for the first time .
your programme forgets the regions and does not clarify how the subsidiarity protocol will be applied .
does this not seem a bad symptom ?
europe will be built by bringing together people , knowledge , will and political reality .
es prime minister , welcome .
i am glad that the matter of energy security has also been included in spain's priorities .
that is illustrative of the importance which it ascribes to consumer protection .
we therefore wonder what the presidency is intending to do about the rights of its citizens .
does it intend to safeguard them by revising the proposed full harmonisation downwards or to restrict the commitments announced ?
the lack of vision in the social sector is not limited solely to consumers .
young people in particular are in a quagmire .
we call on the spanish presidency to revise its programme so as to safeguard permanent jobs for its citizens .
the further large scale immigration you are advocating can only lead to large scale problems .
de mr president , mr rodríguez zapatero , I must compliment you on your eloquence .
however , what do you really have to say ?
what is your message to us ?
i would like to make one thing clear europe cannot afford a 20 % unemployment rate .
what is so good about this spanish model then ?
how have you responded to the crisis ?
how can you coordinate things here ?
we call for your leadership .
then we will support you .
however , what can we do with something so non committal ?
of course we are opposed to marital violence , who would not be ?
he resisted the opposition of the council to the stability and growth pact .
he is the example you should follow .
help him to secure the stability and growth pact .
help him to do this and you will have us on your side .
however , with this non committal pie in the sky approach , we will not make any headway in europe .
mr zapatero most definitely mentioned unemployment , including unemployment in his own country .
unemployment as a whole is something that worries us .
at its last part session , parliament debated turkey and , in particular , the country's democratisation .
this is clearly reflected in both parliament's resolution and the council conclusions of 8 december .
i would also like to mention some other aspects of the council conclusions .
i will now give the floor to commissioner füle .
i would also like to congratulate him because it is his first day in office .
thirdly , I am delighted that the european parliament expressed its strong support for enlargement in three reports .
your report thus reinforces the messages and supports the work undertaken by the commission .
the ball is clearly in croatia's court .
croatia has come a long way over recent years but important challenges still remain to be tackled .
we are encouraged by recent developments in fighting corruption .
we hope that investigation into wrongdoing leads to concrete results .
i hope that the work of the task force will soon produce concrete results .
as regards the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , 2009 was a good year as regards its reform process .
it achieved visa liberalisation , and the commission could recommend starting accession negotiations .
now the challenge for the country is to maintain the reform momentum .
while the country met the political criteria , there is still much work to be done .
the economic crisis has not left the country untouched .
unfortunately , the country was already suffering one of the highest unemployment rates in europe .
equally important , it will enhance the european perspective for the wider region .
it is therefore in the strategic interest of the european union .
work on the political criteria remains of the utmost importance , in particular , as regards fundamental freedoms .
a number of landmark reforms have been carried out in the past year .
some of them were next to impossible only a few years ago .
this is a landmark achievement in civilian military relations .
we will observe closely the follow up of this conciliation .
we continue to support the democratic opening launched by the government .
the success of this initiative requires the participation and support of all political parties and all segments of society .
we also regret the arrests that took place in the south east at the end of december .
we condemn the terrorist attacks that took place at the same time .
none of these developments is really conducive to the successful implementation of the democratic opening .
of course , it is also croatia's responsibility , in particular , to take the decisive steps .
croatia has shown that no one is outside the law or exempt from measures to combat corruption .
this sends out an important signal .
i hope that the same thing will happen soon in slovenia .
however , there is still some work to be done .
the point has already been made that the fight against corruption is an important element .
however , the situation will not change overnight .
mr brammertz has assured the committee on foreign affairs that a great deal is being done .
it may be that some of them have never existed .
nevertheless , I hope that croatia does everything in its power in this respect .
however , I believe that a great deal of progress has been made in this area .
a great deal has also been achieved with regard to the return of refugees or internally displaced persons .
there are still a few problems at a detailed level which are relatively difficult to solve .
it is true that a great deal of progress has been made in this area .
and that is what I , too , have said in my draft report .
secondly , fyrom was the first country in the region to comply with all the visa liberalisation requirements .
it has also cooperated successfully with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
last week , the fyrom parliament passed a resolution on srebrenica .
what are we trying to achieve in parliament with this resolution and with my report on fyrom's progress ?
above all , we want to help .
we want to help fyrom progress along the road of stability towards the european union .
we should remember that fyrom was the only former yugoslav republic that successfully avoided milošević's wars .
that is an empirical fact and one which can be proven .
the balkans of today needs that .
i stand together with greece .
let us do everything we can to reach this goal .
let us show solidarity with both greece , our fellow member state , and with the fyrom .
solidarity must be mutual .
we need to bear in mind that the balkans is like a bicycle ride .
if we stopped now , peace , stability , security and social cohesion would break down .
by way of conclusion , let me stress one more fact fyrom has been a candidate since 200we all need to be aware of the consequences of our decisions or failure to take decisions .
i believe that we can only do that if we seek out a broad majority together .
i actually have three messages for turkey .
i will begin with open debate , democratic opening .
mr president , I am therefore calling for additional attention to be paid to enforcement .
i will turn now to the amendments .
on cyprus , I attempted to reach a clear and broad based compromise with the shadow rapporteurs .
turkey needs to know that the supplementary protocol that has been agreed must be accepted without delay .
with this paragraph , then , I am specifically asking turkey to send out positive signals .
this is absolutely necessary .
mr president , we have clear expectations of the council and the commission .
we expect negotiations with croatia to be completed and negotiations with macedonia to be started this year .
however , saying that the ball is solely in croatia's court is totally unacceptable .
three negotiating chapters remain to be opened by the council .
this will allow croatia , if it is treated fairly , to complete the negotiations this year .
i wish you every success .
i believe that this will also be the case today .
croatia is their homeland , too .
that , however , depends primarily on them .
let me conclude by wishing mr füle , our new commissioner , every success .
i know he will do an excellent job .
we are happy to work with you and look forward to our future cooperation .
i would also like to thank mr swoboda for the good cooperation on the croatia report .
i think there was good cooperation in the process and I thank my colleagues .
croatia's quick accession will send out an important signal on security policy to the entire western balkans .
we in the verts / ale group would like to see better results in this area .
we would like to see more transparency and less political influence in this area as well .
the first concerns the fight against corruption .
there have been repeated attacks on people from these minority groups .
we have now received assurances from the croatian government that some of these cases are being investigated .
my final point is that we have no vision for a new energy policy for croatia .
therefore , we would like to call on you to support our amendment we are looking forward to croatia joining the european union soon .
however , candidates must be subject to rigorous and exacting standards as laid out in the copenhagen criteria .
meanwhile , turkey's eu membership application remains problematic , not least in the field of human rights .
we wish to emphasise from the outset that we are in favour of the integration of turkey .
we mean this and we believe in it .
as such , we declare that we disagree with the position that the relevant energy chapter should be opened .
i am sure that everyone will help .
however , is this not unacceptably making everyone equally responsible , making the victim and the occupier equally responsible ?
if we want a solution to the cyprus question , we must underline turkey's responsibilities .
we must speak openly to turkey , whose integration , I repeat in closing , we support .
effective government measures against growing anti semitism in public life in turkey .
a turkish academic recently spoke of a poisoned atmosphere .
turkey must spell out where it stands on the increasingly urgent issue of tehran's nuclear programme .
as a nato member and eu candidate country , turkey must nail its colours to the mast .
it must make a clear choice .
nl mr füle , welcome to the house !
we do not impose any sanctions or next to no sanctions on turkey .
i therefore hope that you will all support this amendment .
what is more , the freedom of the press in turkey is under severe pressure .
when I was visiting turkey , the press was even moved on .
we must strongly condemn this and that is why I have tabled amendment now , ladies and gentlemen , we come to iran , a rogue state .
ladies and gentlemen , we can but express our disgust about this .
i count on your support .
next , I want to mention the negotiations with turkey .
thus , I hope that you will all support my amendments .
the european people's party considers that fyrom went through many positive developments during the last year .
obviously , our political group would have placed greater emphasis on certain aspects .
we need to send out a clear message on that point .
of course , turkey must also take decisive steps on the path towards reform .
skopje has carried out reforms and is on the way to joining the european union .
we welcome this very much and are very pleased about it .
the visa liberalisation was perhaps the clearest and most visible sign .
it was a milestone in our cooperation .
this objective has only been achieved as a result of close collaboration with the eu member states .
it represents openness , interaction and cooperation .
this momentum is diminishing day by day .
in montenegro , for example , the existence of homosexuality is finally being recognised .
we also all agree that the eu must provide all possible support in this process .
bilateral problems , in themselves , should not represent an obstacle to the accession process .
i am sure that you will also begin the process of negotiation with macedonia soon .
i hope this will also be this year .
we value the fact that croatian units , as part of nato , are present in kosovo and afghanistan .
our new ally has bravely supported our fight against terrorism in several nato missions .
this is a good objective , and I call upon everyone to support these efforts .
let us remember this , too , when we look at our eastern neighbour , ukraine .
where is turkey heading ?
is it heading towards a multicultural europe or towards a pan islamic state ?
the issue of the abolition of visas , in particular , has outraged the secular state in turkey .
neither of these promises has been kept .
christian writers and academics are having to go into hiding .
i have not even got on to phenomena such as forced marriages and so called honour killings .
what deadline will the commission issue turkey with to recognise all the member states of the european union ?
when will turkey have to comply with the ankara protocol ?
when will the illegal military occupation of cyprus be brought to an end ?
this context , commissioner , means that the turkish case needs to be handled with great caution .
we need to use the utmost caution in the negotiating process in order not to make any mistakes .
mr president , first , could I repeat in public my own congratulations to commissioner füle .
on turkey , the socialist and democrat group remains pro accession , pro reform .
the commission's progress report says that reform efforts have been resumed but should be intensified .
we agree .
to our cypriot colleagues we understand the pain of injustice you feel .
to others in this house , constructive criticism of turkey is needed we ourselves are critical friends .
these arguments are loathsome and repellent , and so are you .
the shrill voice of the rejectionist must not be allowed to drown us out .
i would like to emphasise two things .
i think that support from the population is a condition for success in the negotiation process .
fr mr president , firstly , I should like to welcome and congratulate commissioner füle .
the 12th hearing of the trial of the alleged assassins of hrant dink was held in istanbul on monday .
this is terrifying and it is a crime .
the members of that family will obviously have to be put in prison .
the fact is , a few years ago , these crimes did not make the headlines .
these are absolutely crucial elements .
i believe that our process must be totally sincere .
first of all , could I call for more honesty in our approach to turkey .
i have one or two questions for the commission .
why are so few chapters open ?
i agree that the turkish garrison in northern cyprus should be much reduced .
it is scandalous that no real progress has been made in opening international trade with northern cyprus .
we do not feel that turkey's membership is either realistic or opportune for many reasons .
i would request that the commission look into this and act proactively in relation to it .
i believe that this is happening in the current negotiations .
in my opinion , we have made very good progress with croatia and we can complete the process quickly .
we must be aware of this , so that we do not arouse false hopes .
both of these things relate to the european perspective , but they use different toolboxes .
for this reason , you have an interesting job and I hope very much that you enjoy it .
i am pleased to follow my distinguished friend , mr brok , who mentioned the copenhagen criteria .
why is this important ?
i therefore say that lesbian , gay and bisexual rights are non negotiable .
bring in anti discrimination legislation now .
we in parliament should welcome that .
but again , on anti discrimination , I wish them to go further .
so , allow turkey to proceed along this route , on the same terms , the same conditions .
if we undermine the principles of accession , we have no principles left .
that seems rather strange to me .
however , I would like to discuss the subject of turkey .
other speakers have said that turkey is a society in motion and that is true .
turkey is moving forwards and backwards .
let us take the example of the armed forces .
that , of course , is not a good thing .
we think that is very good .
there is also theprivate waragainst the doğan group .
all of this is very unfortunate .
another example is that of the role of women .
i do not think that this is the case .
i would also like to say something about what mr howitt has said .
however , this is not an automatic process .
during this process , we are not only responsible for the accession candidate .
our primary responsibility is to the european union .
this seems to me very strange .
there is an accession perspective , but accession will only come about when all the criteria have been met .
mr president , mr lambsdorff made an accusation against the united kingdom .
these are all areas which are not exactly marginal .
you said that the group of the greens / european free alliance wanted enlargement at any price .
on the question of macedonia , there has been a great deal of progress in many areas .
i recognise this and I am pleased about it .
that is european law .
your hearing was truly superb .
i would like to assure mr lambsdorff that mr van orden loves europe very much .
however , he does not want euro bureaucracy to come between that europe and its citizens .
this could give us a certain energy , a certain vigour , so it is worth taking this route .
a europe without that balkan lung is not europe .
this is something which is , truly , very important .
political enlargement with problematic relations with international law is , I would say , problematic in itself .
fathers still sell their daughters or swap them for cattle .
the men who buy wives treat them like slaves .
the name issue is a real political issue in greece .
no greek government can survive if negotiations are allowed to begin without an agreement on the name .
turkey should know how large the turkish dossier is for a country with its size of population .
see the last report of the un high commissioner for refugees .
however , this is an issue that is still pending .
important pieces of the jigsaw have yet to be put in place before membership can be accomplished .
on this matter , the progress report indicates that there is still much to do .
today's motion for a resolution on fyrom tries to mirror this delicate balance .
however , it does not succeed adequately .
indefinite postponement , on the other hand , might encourage equally unproductive behaviour once again .
some of the amendments are positive .
however , I would point out that any form of nationalism damages its own country first .
greece must strike its own balance .
i have only three comments , since much has been said here already in the debate .
my second comment relates to the wordcomprehensiveness.
we must give a clearyesorno.
turkey is playing a very negative role in those negotiations .
it cannot continue to occupy the city of famagusta in breach of the united nations security council resolution .
that is the path turkey is taking at the moment .
the same applies to other candidate countries .
when they reform , they are becoming neighbours .
justice is now the area in which hard hitting reform is still required .
i stress the need to build a true legal culture and mentality in line with european standards .
mr president , greetings to commissioner füle .
the talks between mr christofias and mr talat are , as we know , at a critical stage .
for them to succeed , a settlement has to be carried by public opinion .
confidence building is sorely required .
turkey should send signals .
the time to act is now .
we wish to speak the language of truth with turkey .
hu I would like to comment on the report on croatia and macedonia .
in the case of both countries , issues concerning neighbourly relations have stalled progress .
as the third member of the trio presidency , hungary would like to continue and assist with this process .
de madam president , firstly , congratulations to mr füle on his appointment as commissioner .
it is a very balanced presentation of the progress made in croatia .
it is also important to ensure that the freedom of the press is guaranteed .
these reforms must be initiated and implemented and , above all , they must be supported by the population .
for that process to take place with mutual understanding , it must be assured a high level of quality .
however , good intentions are not everything .
the rapporteur has submitted a very balanced draft resolution .
turkey has indeed made good progress , but many points of concern must be addressed urgently .
the horrible phenomenon of honour killings must be stamped out as well as the killing of transgender persons .
just yesterday , we learned of the umpteenth killing of a transgender woman in antalya .
the turkish government must ensure , as a matter of urgency , that transgender killings no longer go unpunished .
the resolution rightly urges freedom of religion and freedom of expression .
that is a matter of credibility and moral authority .
turkey is clearly a member of the european family and is an important partner in the dialogue between civilisations .
the western balkans and the balkans have never been stable except during the brief era of tito's yugoslavia .
accession to the union is the only option to stabilise the region .
this is a very important issue .
i should like to quote another of the council's conclusions .
in 2004 , the turkish cypriot community clearly expressed its desire to have a future within the eu .
madam president , I should like to welcome commissioner füle and the minister .
everybody will be pleased by the progress that croatia is making in the completion of its accession process .
so , negotiating the transformation demands a major act of political will .
the greatest problem of adaptation , though , lies elsewhere .
let there be no illusions about this .
that may turn out to be the harder task .
however , there are important differences .
may I start by congratulating hannes swoboda on his report on croatia .
we are all delighted that this country will shortly be joining the european union .
turkey needs to honour all its contractual obligations , as all previous candidate countries have done .
accession is and must be the ultimate objective .
however , we cannot have à la carte accession tailored to turkey .
the greek government knows that the process requires new momentum and is genuinely determined that the issue be resolved .
we expect an equally honest stand from the other side .
bg madam president , commissioner füle , welcome to the house .
i wish you every success in your work .
i wish to thank mr swoboda , mr thaler and mrs oomen ruijten for their balanced , objective reports .
the former yugoslav republic of macedonia has made progress in meeting the criteria for initiating the pre accession process .
history must bring us together and not tear us apart .
so called hate talk must not be tolerated .
i want to mention in particular the schoolbooks which children use in school .
they must not contain descriptions inciting a hostile attitude towards other member states .
i wish croatia , macedonia and turkey every success on their european journey .
madam president , we should continue to support the eu membership perspective for the countries of the western balkans .
the whole process supports stability and we should keep up the momentum .
the last commission report points out that fyrom has achieved progress in many areas , and this is commendable .
in my opinion , the name issue should not come first .
these people are subjected to verbal and physical abuse and even legally persecuted for fabricated reasons .
it is a fact that europe can and has the right to continue to enlarge .
in this case , mr posselt , the principle of pacta sunt servanda applies .
you must be familiar with this phrase which was used by your former prestigious leader .
one further point is also very important to me .
however , one thing is clear .
the process will never be linear .
we know this from the history of the european union .
you only need to look at the processes and procedures relating to the treaty of lisbon .
there will always be progress and setbacks in the process in turkey .
however , the treaty of lisbon will also have brought about lasting changes to the european union .
we should be aware of this .
as I have said , both sides must fulfil their undertakings .
that means completing the project of a united europe in the south east .
we need not only a european perspective , but dynamism and stimulation too .
i am particularly pleased that all three countries have paid particular attention to developing relations with their neighbours .
similarly , I wish good fortune and a great deal of wisdom to the spanish presidency .
nl neighbours look after one another , they support each other .
when things are good in the neighbourhood , they are also good for the people who live there .
turkey and cyprus are neighbours .
un secretary general ban ki moon last week indicated a belief that a solution for cyprus is possibly within reach .
yes , turkey must be made to make efforts to bring that solution closer .
that is what we are calling for in the report on which we are about to vote .
it is not just turkey that has to make an effort , however .
ultimately , that is , of course , what we all want a solution .
croatia is showing a good level of regulatory harmonisation with the acquis communautaire .
there is still a need to complete the programme of small scale privatisations and reduce state interference in the economy .
i would also like to congratulate the new commissioner , mr füle , and welcome him to the role .
madam president , I welcome commissioner füle and I would like to congratulate the authors for three well balanced reports .
there is no doubt that the prospect of eu membership has pushed turkey to change for the better .
es madam president , may I welcome the commissioner .
in this decade , enlargement policy has been the european union's greatest success , along with the euro .
that policy should not be held back .
given the time restrictions , I shall just make a few brief comments .
i would like confirmation of that information .
that is why it is wrong to call on all the parties to support the negotiations under way .
the party on which pressure needs to be exerted is turkey as the occupying power .
turkey holds the key to the solution to the cyprus problem and progress with its accession .
cypriots are not second class citizens of some sort of ottoman or other colony .
we are european citizens with european rights .
macedonia has fulfilled the conditions and has been waiting for negotiations to start since 200as mr swoboda said , many things cannot be resolved in the way that we imagine they will be .
my third point concerns the cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
therefore , a common sense approach is needed to these questions .
it is hard to ignore the ambivalence of the cyprus issue .
that is a fact and we must resolve these double standards .
we know that the ankara protocol must definitely be implemented with regard to the cyprus question .
its intention was that everyone , the entire eu , should bring an end to the isolation .
turkey , too , has made significant progress .
if we look at ukraine , we can realise the difference that the very prospect of accession can make .
turkey is welcome to membership on the basis of meeting the copenhagen criteria .
i think this could be seen as a condition for proceeding with negotiations .
de madam president , I would like to comment on two aspects of the turkish issue .
it is generally the ethnic conflicts that are discussed , and rightly so .
there is still work to be done in this area and some difficulties remain .
this has happened recently in the dispute involving the tekel workers .
that is one of the comments that I would like to make .
the eu also supports these rights , in particular , in its role as a social european union .
the second factor is privatisation .
turkey is adapting to the eu and this includes the area of privatisation .
however , it is not only the tekel employees who work in the tobacco industry .
a week ago , I had the chance to go to ankara and speak with the tekel employees .
therefore , we must put the focus on the social aspect of the eu .
i would like to emphasise that once again .
i know we should not talk about the end of the new parliamentary term on the first day .
we also wish this for the countries we are talking about today .
so much for the positive results which the spanish presidency announced that we could expect .
turkey is not a part of europe either geopolitically or in spiritual or cultural terms .
human rights , the rights of minorities and international law remain concepts that are foreign to turkey .
el commissioner , we welcome you and wish you every success in your job .
today , we are debating , among other things , turkey's progress towards europe .
these two debates intersect at one point , they have one common ground .
of course , part of this is spent honouring its obligations as a member of nato .
this has to stop and this must be a strong message sent to ankara by the european parliament .
the union's institutions refer to this country as fyrom .
these provisions are legally binding in terms of international law .
therefore , there is no legal basis for greece to obstruct the country's accession process .
decisions must be taken on the performance of the applicant country .
we need to talk about the merits and closely monitor the implementation of the reforms .
based upon the progress made , the commission proposed that the country be given a date to start negotiations .
of course , talks are continuing , but they have become bogged down by turkey's maximalist claims .
we support the statement that mr lópez garrido gave us this morning .
madam president , I have a brief comment on turkey .
turkey still has some very serious problems in the area of human rights .
these minorities are suffering from constant violations of their rights .
cyprus and greece are , and will remain , of the utmost importance to the european union .
some of them are throwing around unrealistic dates .
we will strengthen pro european forces only if we adopt a realistic approach and behave appropriately .
false promises are detrimental for both them and us .
let us be fair , let us be correct and let us be credible .
in turkey , we still have a problem with the obstacles faced by religious communities concerning their legal status .
the ecumenical patriarchate has limited rights to train clergy and freely elect the ecumenical patriarch .
i am very grateful to the rapporteur for emphasising all these aspects in the report .
at the same time , I regret that this matter was completely ignored in mr lópez garrido's speech .
mr lópez garrido , I have a personal comment ideology and human rights do not mix .
madam president , I would like to speak on the issue of turkey .
the united kingdom is full .
we have millions of people unemployed .
the pressure on our public services is incredible .
the thought of turkey joining is not on at all .
we have been denied a choice .
the people in our country have been denied a vote on lisbon .
we certainly need a discussion in our country about whether we should be in the european parliament or not .
i fear that turkey joining will be the straw that breaks the camel's back .
the addition of turkey joining will just make matters far , far worse .
commissioner , it is your first day at work .
do we still consider the values , the shared european values , important ?
these values are based on the teachings of christianity , irrespective of the proportion of actively religious people .
do we deem the cultural heritage of europe important as a cohesive force ?
if the answer isyes, turkey has no place in the european union .
naturally , we should aim to establish the best possible partnership with them .
i would have to state that israel does not have a place in the european community , either .
what can we do ?
there was to have been either a breakthrough in accession negotiations or an end of the talks .
today , talks are still in progress on further areas related to accession .
the negotiations in themselves are a positive thing .
unfortunately , it needs more than a minute .
i can assure you that greeks are neither nationalists nor expansionists .
serious academics in skopje do not support the nationalistic trends of their prime minister .
i welcome the progress recorded on internal reform , as is also indicated in the 2009 progress report .
croatia will conclude accession negotiations this year .
in fact , the report we are debating today is the last progress report produced by the european parliament .
we need instruments in this process .
i therefore welcome the progress reports for croatia and macedonia , which are valuable instruments .
i think that these instruments must be considered by the european commission and the governments of croatia and macedonia .
can I ask mrs flautre a question ?
can we ask mr füle to carry out an investigation into honour killings in turkey ?
fr madam president , a question , yes , but which question ?
addressed to whom and for what purpose ?
i mentioned this just now in my speech .
that is why I mentioned earlier that the accession meetings to be held with croatia will begin immediately .
so progress has been made with regard to croatia , as mr poręba has emphasised .
turning now to macedonia , the debate centred primarily on the question of its name .
candidate countries , like member states , must therefore show the utmost sensitivity in matters such as this .
we hope to open other negotiation chapters during the spanish presidency .
we all agree , of course , that turkey has to comply with the additional protocol .
so I repeat , neighbourly relations are an indispensable requirement for measuring turkey's progress in the negotiations .
in any case , madam president , the presidency's position on negotiations with turkey is absolutely clear .
let me make two general observations .
first , I take the promises I made during the hearings very seriously .
in talking to the candidate countries and the prospective candidate countries , I always underlined the following four principles .
the first is strict commitment to the copenhagen criteria they are non negotiable .
thirdly , the process being honest and reflecting credibility on both sides and at all levels .
fourthly , I will never underestimate the issue of integration capacity .
nonetheless , the country continues to face many pressing challenges , including the political criteria .
i know , however , that the turkish government is still committed to the democratic opening .
nevertheless , I remain concerned about restrictions on press freedom and media pluralism .
i am hopeful that we will be able to open more chapters this year .
however , turkey will need to make additional efforts in order to be able to fulfil the demanding benchmarks .
the commission's director general responsible for these issues will be in ankara next week for talks .
let me also add , having been requested , the following position of the commission .
the green line regulation is facilitating economic and personal contacts between turkish cypriots and greek cypriots .
the commission remains committed to the accession process with turkey .
our leverage and influence in turkey will become all the more credible and stronger if our commitments remain unambiguous .
i am looking forward to a very fruitful and close cooperation over the next five years .
the vote will take place during today's vote .
certain passages of the resolution proposed by the committee on foreign affairs are also quite strict .
it is commendable that the new macedonian democracy has made further progress in all areas of society and business .
i very much welcome the fact that the presidential and local elections in march 2009 went smoothly .
this is an indication of the growing democratisation throughout the entire region which was reflected in macedonia .
this represents a major step forward .
however , macedonia still has a number of reforms to implement .
there are two areas where we should strengthen our cooperation with regard to transformation and eu standards .
these are reform in the public administration , in the judiciary and in the police .
croatia's accession to nato in april 2009 has definitely strengthened her claim for accession to the eu .
stabilisation in what is known historically as the balkan cauldron will be guaranteed only by croatia's accession .
i welcome the progress made by croatia , in particular , in combating corruption .
measures must be taken against corruption within the institutions .
not all the countries of central and eastern europe came into the european family at that time .
in 2007 , rumania and bulgaria became member states of the european union .
however , the accession of these countries cannot be thought of as the end of european union enlargement .
at the moment , the country which is closest to acceding to the eu is croatia .
i appeal to both sides of the negotiations for maximum flexibility and the will to reach agreement .
this is why turkey must step up the reform process in order to meet the commitments it has assumed .
let me give you a few examples on this point .
i would like to draw attention to notorious cases of violations of the rights of women .
the unimaginable suffering of the dying teenager was inflicted as satisfaction forbringing dishonouron the family .
this difference is a serious obstacle in building a common identity .
turkey's involvement in guaranteeing the eu's energy security is just as important .
last year , I welcomed turkey's participation in the nabucco project with the signing of the intergovernmental agreement .
consequently , I urge turkey to make an explicit commitment to implementing the nabucco project .
eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities 
after the vote 
de mr president , I have no problem with the machine .
i simply want to make a suggestion .
some members have the habit of not reading out the number for roll call votes .
very well , thank you for your courtesy .
administrative cooperation in the field of taxation 
mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes , duties and other measures 
recent earthquake in haiti 
situation in iran 
de mr president , this has been discussed with the groups .
i will read the text out briefly in english 
thank you for this valuable suggestion which we will forward to the appropriate department .
situation in yemen 
trafficking in human beings vote 
outcome of the copenhagen summit on climate change 
before the vote 
i shall be brief .
climate protection must not come to a standstill .
i would ask for your support .
the amendment is therefore withdrawn .
before the vote on amendment 10 
mr president , amendment 10 by the greens is not in conflict with amendment amendment 1 is about raising our ambition level to more than amendment 10 our amendment is about clarifying conditions to minus this is additional to , not in conflict with , amendment 1 , so amendment 10 should be voted .
this is a new idea and we should vote on it .
promoting good governance in tax matters 
equality between women and men in the european union 2009 
key objectives for the conference of the parties to the cites vote 
before the vote on amendment 12 
it we have not voted on the original text .
we approved amendment 7 and the paragraph falls .
so sometimes the presidency is right .
are we here to vote as we were elected to do , or not ?
please put it to the vote again so that people can make the right decision .
we cannot create a precedent , the voting cannot be repeated .
in any case , there is a difference of 130 votes .
it is not a small difference .
i do not think that it will be possible to overturn and change the results of the vote .
2009 progress report on croatia 
before the vote on amendment 35 
2009 progress report on the former yugoslav republic of macedonia 
before the vote on amendment 18 
2009 progress report on turkey 
before the vote on amendment 13 			   
it is a pity that it took an economic crisis to motivate this step .
mr president , the greatest constraint on a government is external competition .
the good news is that the electorate does not like it .
who could possibly disagree with cooperation ?
it does not avoid taxation .
what it tries to do is avoid double taxation .
people from eu countries still pay tax within their member states .
it is time to stop this imperialism .
the top 10 is dominated by microstates liechtenstein , luxembourg , brunei , jersey and so on .
if colleagues doubt that , then I suggest they look around them .
to these sums can also be added the more than eur 92 million already pledged by individual member states .
thank you , mr president . I wanted to stress this point .
the european union has done its share and continues to do so .
it is the main international donor .
we would have liked her to be in haiti helping others .
it is important that they are focused on the long term recovery of this terribly impoverished island .
we must also prevent the risk of child trafficking .
only rarely can earthquakes such as this be predicted .
they happen unexpectedly .
as the old saying goes , we are as strong as our weakest link .
now the solidarity of the european union is also being gauged .
how successful the aid and cash effort is will be assessed with reference to these criteria .
in this way , we can ensure that the aid gets to those who need it .
mr president , friday will mark one month since the devastating earthquake in haiti .
the death toll is now believed to be 230 000 , with 300 000 injured .
meanwhile , of course , the americans were delivering real aid in the most extraordinarily swift manner .
and what thanks did they get ?
they were accused by a french minister of having occupied the country .
if he intervenes , he is imperialist . if he does not , he is isolationist .
greece is on the verge of fiscal collapse .
we are about to mandate a bail out in plain violation of article 125 of the treaties .
one recent case , for example , was that of 17 year old mosleh zamani in december 200unfortunately it seems that prohibiting the execution of children is not a political priority in the international arena .
i am also saying this on a special day for italians , because today is the day of remembrance .
our declaration today also shows that the commission , the council and parliament are speaking with one voice .
all this has been possible partly due to the wait and see , over tolerant attitude of the west .
fi mr president , it is very obvious that the situation in iran has reached crisis point .
it would seem that we in the eu are incapable of talking to iran .
this being so , we need to find a new path .
in any case , we must be clear and defend european values even in our relations with the iranians .
we should take note of the great culture and history of this country .
the current authorities in iran are , perhaps , denying that great history and culture .
we should see the future authorities of iran as a partner .
we continue to receive information about further executions and more death sentences .
the first reason is specific .
europe must take more decisive action to restrict this shameful procedure .
fi mr president , human trafficking is always an act against humanity .
it is very important for us in europe ultimately to take tangible steps to counter it .
that must not be so we need concrete action .
human trafficking is also still a serious problem within the european union .
we need to make every possible effort to fight human trafficking , which mainly affects children and women .
we , as europeans , must always defend it , and in all circumstances .
it is very easy to refrain from acting because others are doing nothing .
we have taken a strong stance , however , and we have to proceed from that .
this making of excuses is irresponsible and indefensible .
there are many things we can do to maintain our strong stance .
this has not been done so far .
we cannot resolve additional problems without additional resources .
we therefore need to make a commitment , and we cannot afford to wait any longer to do so .
we took a firm stance at copenhagen .
that is why we are taking on this responsibility here today .
mr president , I welcome the opportunity to support this resolution .
the copenhagen summit was a disappointment in many respects .
we have to enhance and promote further activities aimed at climate change treatment .
this means that concentrating solely on co2 will not make the world a better place .
we have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states .
how can we negotiate more effectively with the developing countries and emerging economies ?
is it essential that these negotiations take place under the aegis of the un ?
recently , there has been an increasing number of reports of climate scientists having faked data .
it is important for us to discuss this and make our opinions known .
i have experienced a great deal in my long career as a politician .
for this reason , I have voted against this motion for a resolution .
the environment is altogether too important to be left to the left .
maybe we should consider why that was .
let us look at our own behaviour here in this european parliament .
these scandals are a lot more serious in terms of their consequences than this house would like to believe .
i have been concerned about climate change throughout my 10year career as an mep .
the worst of it is that the eu does not follow what is happening in climate research right now .
we have come up with panic solutions based on distorted information .
glaciers are not melting everywhere .
in any event , contrary to what the ipcc announced , they are not melting in the himalayas .
water levels are not about to rise and cover bangladesh , quite the contrary .
the ganges delta is rising as a result of alluvial deposits .
white bears , which are said to be disappearing , have never been as prolific as they are today .
it is probably astronomic in origin and not caused by the alleged greenhouse gases .
we already opposed this difficult topic during the electoral campaign and included it in our manifesto .
how are we to explain this difference between the two unions ?
you only have to look at the evidence in a number of member states to consider the answer .
we have countries that have run up big debts .
so , really , what should we be doing ?
secondly , it suggests an eu level levy on taxation areas .
we have resisted plans for this parliament to have europe wide taxes .
although some considerations may be well intentioned , let us not forget that too much protection destroys all protection .
our group does not disagree with the observation that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
we do not agree with this .
it is therefore not our responsibility in the eu to interfere in this issue .
pl mr president , I , too , voted against this report .
i did so despite being a supporter of gender equality .
in my country , abortion is not understood in this way .
i am persuaded that how we view abortion is our own internal matter .
it is also dangerous that the report violates the subsidiarity principle , and does so on an ill matter .
pl mr president , equality between women and men is an important subject .
unfortunately , I regret that I could not support this proposal .
firstly , these matters are among those which are exclusively for member states to decide .
i think human life deserves better .
let me explain myself better it talks about violence , about protection against violence .
equal rights , equal opportunities and equality between the genders in everyday life is definitely in all our interests .
perhaps they have not read it .
nurseries should only be the last resort .
mr president , the treaty of rome contains one sentence on this subject .
it says ,men and women shall be given equal pay for equal work.
now , that sounds pretty straightforward .
we all think we understand what that means .
first , it definedequal payas meaning equal pension rights and equal holidays and so on .
then it definedequal workas being work of equivalent value .
how is an employer supposed to judge that ?
is it a question of how hard it looks like someone is working ?
do they have to factor in the availability of suitably qualified applicants ?
now we are talking about reproductive rights .
there is an argument for all of these things .
it is outrageous for them to be imposed on us by a court .
a court with a mission is a menace a supreme court with a mission is a tyranny .
this type of report damages our acceptance among the population and among the candidate countries .
some of the ideological elements relating to croatia and macedonia in the progress reports are also doing us harm .
mr president , let me tell you the story of two african countries .
result explosion of elephant numbers .
we in this house do not think of the elephant in the way that the african does .
this , of course , is what rhodesia now zimbabwe successfully did .
environmental policy should recognise the basic aristotelian wisdom that that which nobody owns , nobody will care for .
i am talking , of course , about the border dispute between slovenia and croatia .
this is not merely an abstract concept it is one that affects people's lives .
that of course constitutes interference with the competence of the slovene parliament .
and yet , this principle has not been enshrined in the arbitration agreement .
i have therefore voted against the motion for a resolution because it does not reflect this principle .
cs mr president , I , too , will be brief .
the recent elections have helped in this .
they have shown clearly that the citizens of this country want to share international standards and peaceful coexistence .
i also believe that democratic institutions will manage to strengthen negotiations with greece concerning amicable solutions to problem areas .
cs I will be very brief again .
despite this , a majority of meps supported the start of accession talks some years ago .
turkey is not a european country , but it is our most important partner on the margins of europe .
however , we do want close economic and political cooperation .
according to the progress report for 2009 , turkey still has a long way to go .
i was among the first supporters of the idea behind the european commission's proposal .
we in the committee on economic and monetary affairs have analysed and somewhat improved the commission's document .
in fact , member states should have the option either to require transaction by transaction reporting or global transaction reporting .
it is with great conviction that I voted in favour of mr casa's report .
a common and particularly serious form of this fraud is known as carousel vat fraud .
the total amount of uncollected income is estimated at between eur 20 and 100 billion per annum .
criminals active in this area are particularly inventive .
missing traders then fail to remit the vat to the national exchequer .
it is crucial that we tackle this kind of crime .
i welcome the application of the reverse charge vat system .
however , I discern an error in it .
meanwhile , subject a does not pay vat , as he is not the end seller .
only subject c selling the final goods to the consumer pays vat .
that is why I voted in favour of this legislative resolution .
the only references which anyhow are already in the commission's proposal concern the roma population .
when signing international treaties , european parliament experts will also be included in the discussions .
these are the people most in need , and they should not be excluded by reason of their location .
this is a global problem , and it affects thousands of families all over europe !
this justifies the adoption of a special rule within the erdf regulations .
living conditions are crucial for every citizen's self esteem and sense of social worth .
these are the reasons that led me to vote in favour of the following amendments .
therefore it makes no sense to limit the regulation to only the new eu 12 member states .
it has a duty and the means to ensure this .
the eu cannot allow itself to become a socially underdeveloped region .
it will thus be possible to establish an integrated and sustainable approach at eu level .
this report gives the eu concrete means for helping its citizens .
let us hope that it will be a step towards a social europe close to the people .
i welcome the second point of this initiative to direct funds earmarked for renovation to rural areas .
this would make it easier for the member states to legally implement the cofinancing for rural home renovation .
they are unable to benefit from erdf support .
intervention in the housing sector is possible during urban development operations and by renovating existing houses .
the objective of the proposal is to provide acceptable housing conditions within the framework of an integrated approach .
i believe that the compromise agreed today will be a useful tool in combating fraud and evasion .
but when the protection of banking data is at issue , the good suddenly turns into the evil .
this inconsistency cannot even be justified in the name of efficiency .
the automatic exchange of all data on every non resident in europe will lead to an unmanageable flood of data .
the precedent in the field of taxation of savings should set alarm bells ringing .
the aim of the directive is to improve administrative cooperation in the field of taxation .
now more than ever , we need to help each other in this field .
the mobility of taxpayers , the number of cross border transactions and the globalisation of financial instruments have evolved considerably .
it is hard for the member states to assess the amount of taxes and duties correctly .
this is putting the smooth operation of the internal market at risk .
the statistics show us that the overall recovery rate is just 5 % .
in order to improve the effectiveness of claim recovery activities , closer cooperation is required at member state level .
with this in mind , I voted for the proposal on mutual assistance in this area .
national provisions relating to recovery only apply within the territory of each member state .
the administrative authorities are unable to recover taxes and duties themselves outside their own member state .
that is why I voted in favour of this resolution .
the european union has all the data and instruments for getting involved in the long term reconstruction of haiti .
i had the pleasure and honour of contributing to the drafting of this resolution by parliament .
this proved that the investment demanded by parliament over the years can have a practical and positive impact .
on the other hand , as after the asian tsunami , we need to draw lessons from what happened .
haiti and its people need fire fighters , doctors , hospitals and basic necessities .
unfortunately , too much time was wasted on protection , and not everything has gone smoothly .
we regret that the resolution passed does not go far enough in defending haiti and its people .
we will continue to express our sincere solidarity with the people of haiti .
this makes the catastrophe even bigger than the 2004 asian tsunami .
after emergency aid , our focus should gradually turn to the long term development of haiti .
finally , some colleagues have questioned baroness ashton's decision not to visit haiti immediately after the earthquake .
their criticism is right if her visit would have resulted in something useful in helping the haitians .
mr president , I voted in favour of the resolution on haiti .
the number of those in need of outside assistance is estimated at two to three million .
while the sympathies of europeans are with the relatives of the victims , there is a need to act .
the largescale and prompt commitments in the form of assistance from the eu are obviously vital .
the tardy reaction on the part of the new foreign affairs administration has provoked amazement , with good reason .
haiti will need help for a long time .
its wounds need tending and its homes need building one by one .
you cannot tot up pain .
there is no aggregate consciousness that would suffer more distress than a single one .
the distress of the masses is always the distress of the single person .
i think that the eu needs to promote better coordination and a higher profile in supporting the haitian state .
i am pleased that the eu has responded swiftly with eur 196 million so far in assistance .
we must act cautiously in this case .
the tragedy has turned the eyes of the entire world on haiti .
therefore , I support the call to cancel haiti's international debt .
i voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the recent earthquake in haiti .
in the event of a natural disaster , humanitarian aid needs to arrive without delay .
in haiti , only the united states was able to provide effective humanitarian aid without bureaucratic delay .
the eu must not intervene in this situation as it will only exacerbate the tense situation .
negotiations should be taken in cooperation with other national governments , not forced upon from above by the eu .
however , the proposed text does not do this in the best way .
the adopted text does not make any mention of this .
this leads us to condemn the policies pursued by the iranian regime .
there are many countries where democracy and human rights are in a precarious position .
the eu must continue its attempts to change this situation by means of appeals and similar methods .
we should not be surprised by the actions of iran and its attempts to become a nuclear power .
this is a result , among other things , of misguided us policy .
i am in agreement with this .
i am glad the eu is taking a very clear position on this matter .
there is definitely a lack of respect for human rights and democracy in iran in its current situation .
however , tightening sanctions against iran is not the right approach to take .
apart from this , the eu is once again applying double standards .
for these reasons , I have abstained .
in writing . the ecr supported a strong resolution on iran .
we are in favour of robust international action to deal with iran's growing nuclear capability .
it should also be clarified that fortunately there are noeu embassiesin tehran .
there are national embassies .
the islamic republic of iran is unstinting in condemning poor treatment of muslims throughout the world .
conversion to christianity is considered as a form of apostasy and is punished by the death penalty .
combating poverty and increasing military aid will not make yemen's problems disappear .
ultimately , the eu must not allow itself to be forced into the role of paymaster for the us .
i asked to have references to the eas removed during the drafting stage , but other political groups refused .
in writing . ukip is totally opposed to people trafficking as it is a modern day version of slavery .
in writing . trafficking in human beings is one of the most horrific and serious crimes .
tens of thousands of young women and children from new member states become victims of human trafficking every year .
the european parliament will have a crucial role to play in combating trafficking in human beings .
i voted for this resolution because the european union must combat illegal immigration and human trafficking .
such a situation can be exploited by criminal gangs .
we must strive for closer cooperation among all the interested parties on the question of human trafficking .
this is unacceptable , and legal loopholes must not be allowed to facilitate it .
we need a rapid , global , comprehensive and coordinated response , whether it be legislative or operational .
this is a first step .
sadly , this terrible reality also takes place within the european union .
i therefore urge the european commission to take strict and robust measures to combat trafficking in people .
you are irresponsible !
mr president , I endorsed adoption of the resolution on human trafficking .
human trafficking is one of the worst wrongs which people can inflict on others .
it is horrifying how common this terrible phenomenon is .
human trafficking is a negation of liberty , dignity and equality .
international estimates state that trafficking in people is the third most lucrative illegal trade .
human trafficking is one of the greatest plagues of the beginning of this century .
those who call it a modern form of slavery cannot be accused of exaggeration .
it is an activity which is exceptionally profitable , and is controlled by dangerous , organised criminal gangs .
i hope this will provide a new stimulus to intensify action against human trafficking .
we need to coordinate information better in order to combat this growing phenomenon more effectively .
human trafficking is the most flagrant form of human rights violation .
the number of victims of this modern form of slavery rises from year to year .
the detection rate for this type of crime is very low .
therefore , I endorse the resolution of the european parliament on preventing trafficking in human beings .
giving incidental , individual items of information about cases of human trafficking which have been uncovered is not sufficient .
it took lawyers as long as three years to ratify it .
allowing the eu to set tougher sanctions in this area ,
references to the treaty of lisbon strengthening eu action in criminal matters ,
and the establishment of a superordinate legislative framework in this area .
it was I who launched the campaigndo you know where your child is now ? 
in writing . ukip believes that environmental protection is important .
the next revised version of the budget must provide sufficient resources for measures that can meet this important challenge .
we cannot lose sight of our commitment to combating climate change .
as europeans , we must commit to a target reduction in co2 of more than 20 % by 20both europe and the rest of the world invested much hope in the copenhagen conference .
we cannot be driven to mexico by the vague and disheartening copenhagen agreement .
the outcome of the 15th conference of the parties cop 15 was disappointing .
we cannot repeat the same errors that occurred in copenhagen .
what we need is another economic and social model that opposes capitalism .
this resolution testifies to the fact thatbelieversin the ipcc's views have not understood anything .
these last two stipulations are missing from the resolution , and I therefore voted against its adoption .
i voted against the resolution because it contains too much wishful thinking .
last year , china became the world's leading exporter of wind turbine equipment and photovoltaic cells .
this is done by setting ambitious objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 20 % by 20in writing . the copenhagen summit was very much a missed opportunity in efforts to tackle climate change .
this problem , which is a matter of concern all over the world , needs a fast solution .
the eu must be capable of taking a leading role in the fight against climate change .
the sustainable future of humanity is at issue here .
if nothing is done in time , we could reach the point of no return .
i therefore believe we need to propose a new economic and social model to challenge capitalism .
the copenhagen climate summit was rightly considered by most observers to be a failure .
the european union must begin efforts to ensure that the cop 16 conference in mexico will end with success .
in my opinion , we are still at a stage when making binding and final decisions is inadvisable .
there is simply no alternative to collective action on this issue .
this parliament must continue to support this approach .
it is important that lessons should be drawn from the failure in copenhagen .
i hope that mexico will have a successful outcome .
i have voted against the resolution .
unfortunately , a number of good amendments were rejected .
people's sense of reality with regard to climate protection seems to have gone out of the window .
this is not what I understand to be a responsible policy for our citizens .
it can do so if it is able to provide itself with the necessary resources .
the copenhagen conference was a failure .
reduction targets must be measurable , significant and verifiable for everyone if there is to be climate justice .
there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues it raises .
a ccctb is not about a common tax rate .
taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each member state .
we will not be used as a moral alibi for such a policy .
in writing . using ccctb to combat double taxation is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut .
there are much more efficient ways of combating the issue of double taxation .
that is why I voted against recital studies show this is the most effective way to tackle tax evasion and protect revenues .
the report refers to the forthcoming impact assessment on the proposed common consolidated corporate tax base .
moreover , good tax governance is an important pre condition for preserving the integrity of financial markets .
such statements must , however , be followed by the conclusion of legally binding agreements .
and for this reason , I will vote in favour of the report .
a deduction at source on all financial transactions would be a far more effective method .
such a deduction at source should be a final tax .
it could become a european resource .
the so calledgood governancerecommended by the european parliament lays bare every aspect of citizensprivacy .
it is for these reasons that I have not voted in favour of these reports .
vat , which this text also supports , is one of the aberrations of this system .
we believe that measures at national level are more appropriate in this domain .
there were a number of amendments which directly or indirectly made a reference to abortion .
malta is against abortion .
the main political parties are in complete agreement on this issue .
the greater part of society also concurs with this view .
in addition , the religious and moral aspects are an important element .
these differences between men and women have been particularly exacerbated by the current economic , financial and social crisis .
every member state must ensure that workers of both genders receive equal pay for work of equal value .
the victims of human trafficking are mostly women .
i welcome the adoption of this report on equality between men and women in the eu .
this report underlines the urgent need for a community initiative to effectively combat violence against women .
also , the adoption of this resolution integrates two dimensions , which I consider to be fundamental .
firstly , the recommendation for paternity leave at european level .
this resolution highlights the commission's responsibility to legislate in this area .
however , the real major victory of this vote is that it reaffirms the right to abortion .
no european text has reaffirmed this right since 2002 , due to the reticence of one right wing european party .
women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
it also promotes a much wider awareness of sexual health matters for both women and men .
however , this is not a legislative proposal .
this is primarily a statement of principles which I am comfortable in supporting .
it is consistent with the principles espoused by labour and social democratic parties across europe .
this report does not and cannot change that position .
equality between women and men has long been a fundamental principle of the european union .
however , despite the progress made in this field , many inequalities between remain .
four times more women than men across europe work part time .
the gender pay gap 17.4 % has barely narrowed since 2000 .
the global economic , financial and social crisis is causing women to suffer adouble blow.
the report of marc tarabella clearly emphasises the greatest barrier to gender equality .
i know that some members do not take the issue of gender inequality and related discrimination against women seriously .
however , I am aware of these complications .
a fair division of the family and domestic responsibilities of women and men will help to resolve the situation .
relevant and serious issues like this deserve our attention , discussion and a search for the greatest common denominator .
i do not even think that this should be difficult to achieve .
once again , parliament has acted as a mere sounding board for the most extreme agendas .
let us hope that it will come to be implemented in reality .
yes , women encounter specific difficulties .
the report also emphasises that women must have access free of charge to consultation on abortion .
we must stand up for the principle of subsidiarity .
many in my electorate in romania would be disappointed if I voted differently .
many women died as a result of illegal abortions , performed without medical help .
i remain firm in my commitment to promoting a responsible sexual culture .
the patriarchy still completely pervades our societies .
there are still efforts to be made in this area .
women must be able to have full physical autonomy .
that is why I voted in favour of the measures relating to the protection of these rights .
this charter is legally binding and enables women to be protected in the same way as men .
women should have control over their sexual and reproductive rights .
i believe that there has been effective legislation on the protection of women since 197this is an area where the principle of subsidiarity should be applied .
these rights are an essential part of the concept and self image of a modern european society .
i abstained from voting on recital x and paragraph 38 , which concern women's access to abortion .
in my opinion , the current wording would infringe the principle of subsidiarity .
only then can the eu achieve its goals of growth , employment and social cohesion .
another positive feature is the fact that much greater importance is given to the commitment to the family .
the ecr have decided to vote in favour of the paragraphs which support equality in this way .
the ecr group have nevertheless voted against this resolution for two specific reasons .
i voted against this resolution .
it divides rather than unites men and women .
the rapporteur also insists on women having access free of charge to consultation on abortion .
however , abortion comes solely within the competence of the member states .
as this resolution has no binding legal force , it cannot be used to exert pressure to liberalise abortion .
thus , parliament is aiming to destroy the natural family as a place of socialisation and solidarity between generations .
this resolution does not offer any added value to women or to men or to the union .
i voted against the resolution .
the rapporteur , mr tarabella , has not taken account of the national context .
morality is part of the worldview incorporated into the legal system of a country .
i see this conference as crucial to the survival and sustainability of many species .
the reason is that this will affect the livelihood of maltese fishermen in a very negative way .
i voted in favour of the cites convention report .
animal and plant species are becoming extinct at a rate of one thousand times faster than the natural rate .
human activities are adding to this rate of extinction and are endangering biodiversity .
as such , I also support the recommendation that the environmental crime unit be strengthened .
the european parliament is calling for a total ban on the marketing of bluefin tuna internationally .
biological diversity is vital to the wellbeing and survival of humanity .
we must be ambitious and demand the protection of all species that are at risk of extinction .
it aims to prevent the excessive exploitation of these species for international trade .
these must have supporting data and substantiated scientific opinions .
that is indispensable .
the species has suffered a marked decline , is greatly overfished and is threatened by over exploitation for international trade .
it therefore meets the criteria for listing in cites appendix i.
that proposal was not adopted .
the inclusion of corallium spp in appendix ii indeed seems over cautious and not properly corroborated by scientific data .
bluefin tuna is threatened with extinction as a result of the failure to control the overfishing of this resource .
the ban on marketing it now seems inevitable .
it is aimed at protecting this species .
the effort made by these fishermen cannot fall on their shoulders alone .
we must be fair there is a vast difference between industrial fishing and traditional fishing techniques .
faced with fishermen fiercely hostile to this ban , scientific and environmental experts are sounding the alarm .
as for spain and malta , their display of silence is reprehensible .
the urgency is there , however , and only radical measures can enable stocks to be replenished .
small scale and sport fishing will still be permitted .
such industrial and international fishing threatens traditional coastal fishing in the mediterranean .
all the member states are party to it .
unfortunately , the eu is one of the main markets for the illegal trade in wild species .
within the eu , national legislation varies from one member state to another .
the union shall also stand up to the other parties to cites .
that is why I voted in favour of this resolution .
i voted in favour of adopting the 2009 progress report on croatia .
after a period of deadlock lasting more than nine months , accession negotiations resumed in october 200the report also notes a number of issues affecting the process of croatia's integration into the european union .
the report adopted by the european parliament plenary includes amendments which I have tabled .
these amendments encourage croatia to continue its efforts to promote cultural diversity .
in writing . nl has this parliament really not learnt from its past mistakes ?
despite this , the accession of these countries was still voted through , and we all know the consequences .
eu membership and the associated massive streams of funding have further embedded the corruption that was already present .
it is a rocky road and is fraught with difficulties we portuguese know that only too well .
this holds true for croatia and any other potential candidate country .
i know that croatia can live up to its aspirations .
for our part , croatia can count on our complete support .
it is not croatia that I am opposing by voting against this progress report .
the people of croatia do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
croatia is undoubtedly the country among the accession candidates which has made the greatest progress until now .
the implementation of the community acquis is , of course , an essential requirement in this respect .
the report supports croatia's aims , which is why I have voted in favour of it .
croatia has made extensive progress in many respects with regard both to its domestic and foreign policy .
we have adopted an important resolution evaluating the state of accession negotiations with croatia .
the very fact of belonging to a united europe is , certainly , not without significance .
i expect the presidency and the commission to take specific measures in this area .
this is very important for stabilisation in the region .
there is no need to hurry and there is no time pressure that justifies this process .
the resolution on croatia is a political resolution with no legal binding force .
i voted in favour of it , because croatia should become a member state in the near future .
without the balkan war , it would have joined in 200i voted against this paragraph .
there is therefore no reason to suspect that croatia is a nation hostile to the lgbt minority .
despite all symbolic pressure , croatia retains full national competence in areas linked to non discrimination .
some of these are of a material nature , while others are more historical or political .
i sincerely hope that it will .
i also believe that the european union must provide assistance as part of the negotiation process .
sexual orientation is one of the non discrimination grounds in article 21 of the eu charter of fundamental rights .
it is not the fyrom that I am opposing by voting against this progress report .
the people of the fyrom do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
the report gives a very good description of the next steps to be taken .
therefore , I am delighted with its achievements .
2009 was a successful year for macedonia .
the eu introduced a visa free regime with this state .
this in particular fosters the development of people to people contacts .
last year , macedonia demarcated the border with kosovo and improved relations with greece .
we also invited the eu council of ministers to accept the beginning of accession talks with macedonia in march .
the progress made by macedonia in 2009 was also down to the eu's magnetic pull .
therefore , I voted for the resolution , which praises these while also underlining a roadmap for further progress .
it is increasingly destructive of freedom of speech , writing and even thought .
i voted in favour of adopting turkey's progress report 200the european parliament feels that turkey is still not meeting the copenhagen political criteria .
far reaching constitutional reform is required to ensure greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
the situation in turkey has improved in terms of freedom of expression in minoritieslanguages .
yet turkey is a friendly nation , with a very rich history and culture .
it is our partner in nato and deserves to be treated as such .
i believe that the eu must meet the commitments that it has made to turkey .
for its part , turkey must commit further to the reform process that is under way .
it is not turkey that I am opposing by voting against this progress report .
the people of turkey do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
in writing . pt I have reservations about turkey's eu membership .
there are other basic issues .
turkey has an islamic identity that is very different from the judaeo christian identity of most eu countries .
strategically speaking , it would be problematic for the eu to have borders with iraqi kurdistan .
the secularity of the country is only held in place by military force .
turkey has done a great deal in its efforts to comply with the copenhagen criteria .
very significant progress has been made in terms of complying with the standards of a market economy .
it is also a territory which could provide routes for the transfer of energy sources to europe .
the presence of turkey in the union could help stabilise this large and important region of the world .
turkey must understand that it cannot change its past .
mistakes have to be admitted .
then it is easier to live and establish good relations with one's neighbours .
in almost every area , progress has come to a standstill or things are moving backwards .
double standards are being applied to religious freedom .
these are dreadful developments .
turkey has shown very clearly that it is still generations away from joining the eu .
in fact , the reforms are necessary and urgent , as the resolution of parliament ordains .
as you know , the european parliament has been very active in this matter .
our parliament is composed of members directly elected by the citizens of europe .
our main responsibility is for citizensrights , and we must guard these rights .
we are fully aware of this .
this is our first and greatest responsibility .
at the same time , we realise how important the swift agreement is for completely different reasons .
therefore , finding the right middle ground , here , was important .
while this was happening , in recent months , the treaty of lisbon has come into force .
i have also written a letter , saying the same things , to mr barroso .
i have also been in touch with representatives of the american government and with mrs clinton .
this is important .
we must have full information , so that we can make decisions on this matter in a responsible way .
the measures we have taken will also be helped by our discussion today .
that is why this discussion about swift is so important .
this cannot be rectified ex post by mechanisms of oversight and control .
the fact is that this house is always being promised jam tomorrow if only we would be patient .
however , we cannot keep falling for fake promises of jam tomorrow .
we need clear commitments now and the ball was in the council's court .
i made that clear last week , but so far , it has failed to act accordingly .
why hide behind the commission ?
council states yet again that it wants to ensure that the tftp will continue .
the lack of reciprocity is not being addressed .
the council fails to clarify the precise role of the public authority .
tell me I am all ears .
this is an objective that the treaty of lisbon entrusts largely to parliament .
that is the context in which , together , we are fighting terrorism all forms of terrorism .
i agree wholeheartedly with this statement .
mr president , it is widely acknowledged that international terrorism has brought new challenges to our societies .
a global approach is therefore needed to eradicate it .
it lacks a rigid , hierarchical structure and so can only be combated with an extraordinary intelligence effort .
prevention , coordination and intelligence are the three words that sum up our strategy for tackling this huge threat .
the european union has also increased its joint investigation bodies and teams , information exchange and shared analysis .
data exchange without an agreement has worked uninterruptedly for many years .
these are just some of the examples judge bruguière cites in his report .
data exchange has therefore delivered positive results .
it has allowed us to investigate and prevent attacks .
that had to be done in a very short space of time .
the decision that was taken is well known .
that was the decision taken .
it may not have been the best decision .
we now know that the commitment I have just set out is possible .
thank you , mr rubalcaba .
they are available in the political groups for you to see at any time .
in its reply , the council has responded to our expectations , the expectations of parliament .
thank you , mr rubalcaba , for making this declaration and for explaining the council's position on this .
it is very important to us .
the european parliament has , of course , shown great interest in this matter .
the report also highlights that tftp is a valuable source of reliable information necessary in the fight against terrorism .
there are specific examples and the council referred to a few of them .
the interim agreement is not only a favour to the us it is in our common interest .
that means that the data held on the tftp database are effectively anonymous .
this is important .
the agreement does not involve the transfer of virtually all swift data to the us treasury department .
i can assure you that only a fraction of swift data will be transferred under the interim agreement .
so refusal of consent risks leading to both a data protection gap and a security gap .
finally , the interim agreement is only an interim agreement .
it might not be the best agreement in the world .
it can and it will be improved .
the european parliament will be fully informed at all stages of this procedure .
i hope that this answers a few of your questions .
thank you , mrs malmström , for your explanations .
they were , truly , very important for us .
this is important .
we wanted it to be a strong signal .
however , we know we are responsible to our citizens .
we are directly elected members of the european parliament .
our responsibility to defend citizensrights is of fundamental significance and we always stress this .
secondly , we strongly support security for our citizens and also citizensrights and data protection .
our response to the text for the negotiations is to make two very clear points .
firstly , we cannot accept the way in which this text has been produced .
it also became clear that it was only after this that things started to move .
this has allegedly happened on some occasions .
the council has sent out encouraging signals this week , but has not given any guarantees .
i would like to make that very clear .
however , gulliver believed that he had arrived in the land of giants .
that is a mistake .
you have done so yourself .
how long will the data be stored ?
who is storing it ?
who is passing it on to whom ?
under the terms of the homeland security act , data can be stored for up to 90 years .
it is worth repeating that this data can be stored for up to 90 years !
all of these factors represent serious failings in this agreement .
if you can do this , we will support the new agreement .
the objective of a new round of negotiations must be to find a compromise between these two things .
this evening , I will suggest that my group votes against this agreement .
it is a pleasure to see you here .
let us not forget that the member states were not unanimous on this agreement either .
this is about european citizens being entitled to a proper democratic and transparent procedure .
i do not consider that the second bruguière report is sufficient .
so , if the council wants the consent of this house , it will have to meet our demands .
that , council , is the only way .
i am grateful to the americans for taking part in this far reaching dialogue .
the nature of the task which lies ahead of us has become clear to me .
the council has not done this task justice in the past .
the us and europe have completely different definitions of terrorism and this is a problem which pervades this agreement .
we must take action now .
we have told the citizens of europe in the course of the public discussion that we would do so .
we must vote against the interim agreement and we must not postpone our vote .
parliament must not evade its responsibilities again as it did in november .
parliamentary consultation and consent should not be a retrospective tool .
we are now receiving loads of assurances and promises from the council and from the commission .
however , I would like to focus specifically on the content of the agreement .
we have big brother's little sister waiting for our approval .
personal data will be stored for decades and no one will have any control over how it is used .
in addition , the data can still be retained after the agreement has come to an end .
the member states are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the eu .
we find ourselves in a situation in which parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision .
why should google be able to set data thresholds in future ?
in this context , I have heard many speeches which refer to the eu as a community of values .
mt let me make it clear that the european popular party is in favour of this agreement .
it is all for the swift agreement and tomorrow will vote in favour .
this means that a new agreement will have to be drawn up that will provide better guarantees regarding security .
mr president , in your introduction you mentioned responsibility .
if possible , in order to retain more unity in this chamber , tomorrow's vote should be postponed .
this is not a sectarian issue for us but a factual issue .
this is an issue about whether a badly drafted agreement serves the interests of security and anti terrorism .
so we all agree that , for the eu citizens , a good agreement is what we want .
es mr president , I reject the methods and the time used for this agreement .
which report should prevail , ladies and gentlemen ?
no , ladies and gentlemen , we have neither held a debate nor reached a solution on this issue .
the wording of the interim agreement guarantees rights .
i trust the government of the united states and the great democracy by which it is established .
finally , mr president , the council and the commission know what is expected of them .
an interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed .
but you could not do even this today .
the bulk transfer of data , the commissioner said , is not a problem .
only some data will go there .
swift tells us that is not the case .
there is no proof of what you say in this statement .
you mentioned the negotiating guidelines that you are nearly done with .
where are they ?
i feel it is extremely important to fight together with the united states against terrorism .
these attempts to threaten us can be described in one word ridiculous .
the us and the council are not trying to rescue an essential tool they are simply saving face .
there are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism .
swift could be a useful addition to these .
the idea is to divert attention away from this fact .
the interim agreement simply could not be worse .
it is full of contradictions and inconsistencies .
he has also noted that the negotiation of this agreement was not conducted very well , or well enough .
therefore , we must find a balance between security and privacy .
this balance must be reflected in the agreement that we are currently debating .
therefore , I believe that we should aim for a postponement and then ultimately ..
colleagues , this is a very important discussion .
i do not want to disturb you but you are all talking half a minute longer than you should .
there are 11 people on the list .
if you all talk for such a long time then I cannot give the floor to the others .
de mr president , no one has any serious doubts about the need to combat terrorism .
in this case , this question is easy to answer .
in particular , these measures must not be put in place with a total disregard for existing democratic regulations .
therefore , I am in favour of voting against this agreement tomorrow .
then anonymisation services are created on the web , just as now in the banking sector .
if terrorists can hide among ordinary people , security is reduced .
it is a poor agreement .
instead I call for a complete review of all these anti terrorism laws .
what do they cost and what is their collective effect on privacy and liberty ?
only then will I even consider voting in favour of even more anti terrorism laws .
show us how effective these measures are using open documents , not secret ones .
i would like to raise two matters .
i strongly emphasise the wordall.
ro the council sent the agreement to the european parliament very late , which is extraordinary .
i hope that there will be no more recurrences of incidents of this nature .
unexpectedly , they have listened to this institution , something which I hope will be repeated in the future .
the united states have yet to introduce clear , transparent criteria for refusing visas in certain member states .
we should pick up on this and take the opportunity to improve the agreement .
we will therefore find ourselves in exactly the same situation again during the next plenary session .
i do not believe that this will change anything .
we have already been promised before this agreement that this time things would be quite different .
once again , postponement will not help .
we have legal reports that prove this and we have agreements on mutual legal assistance .
there have been many failed or bad investigations in the european union .
in my constituency alone , 12 innocent people were detained and were not able to be charged .
what can we learn from those bad instances ?
we have time .
our backs are not against the wall .
there is a way forward .
let us defer .
the interim agreement that was negotiated lacks data protection .
data protection is not a luxury it is a prerequisite of our freedom .
there is a lack of reciprocity and a lack of proportionality .
we cannot allow this .
we certainly hope that the final agreement will be properly negotiated .
how can it be negotiated ? is it negotiated from a poor basis or a reasonable basis ?
sk the saying goes that good agreements are made by equal partners .
i know that there are countries in the european union that have enormous problems with terrorism .
in my opinion , this consensus is extremely important , and we should not forget it .
i would like to make three comments regarding the issue itself .
this is just one example .
i would like to make two more points on this matter .
the perpetrators of these attacks are all currently serving sentences in spanish prisons .
we would certainly be a little less secure it is as simple as that .
the agreement under debate today is probably not perfect .
the council is making a commitment to do this .
therefore , we are debating an interim agreement today which improves the current situation .
the council cannot ignore this afternoon's debate .
we cannot ignore the fact that this agreement has come in for a great deal of criticism .
i am asking on behalf of the council , that parliament give us this time for reflection .
concerns , which , I repeat , echo the council's concerns in many cases .
member of the commission . mr president , this has been an extremely important debate .
some of them are answered in the bruguière report , so I would really encourage you to read that .
we did achieve certain concessions from the united states and some very good data protection mechanisms .
this is important to recall .
now this is an interim agreement , as I said it can and it will be improved .
we need to have more clarification concerning redress , lawful data processing and deletion of data .
mr lambrinidis asked why the commission does not have that .
well , mr lambrinidis , the commission has been in office for 16 hours and 20 minutes .
this is an extremely important negotiating mandate .
we have only very recently taken office so you could not expect us to have done this .
we must take a decision tomorrow .
give me more time to come back to you with a better agreement . 
have I understood what you said correctly ?
even more importantly , I have asked for time to consult with the united states .
de mr president , that is very helpful .
thank you very much for making this possible .
in other words , if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time , it will come into effect .
it is very hard for parliament to accept an unconditional assurance .
mr rubalcaba , you have put your finger on it .
most of the arguments put forward for debate in the house have been fair ones .
i have great respect for everything that has been said .
in her letter , mrs hennis plasschaert asks the same question as manfred weber .
in my opinion , we are capable of achieving this .
this is precisely what I am asking for .
i believe that in these circumstances , the debate we are having today would be radically different .
rapporteur . mr president , a lot has been said .
i think it is very unfair to use that as a form of argument .
it is very non committal .
it must be seen , and I want it acknowledged , as a departure from european law and practice .
i said this before and I want to hear it again clearly .
the netherlands and belgium cannot end up being thedupeof all this .
the vote will take place on thursday , 10 february 20written statements rule 149 
cooperation with the united states to combat terrorism is important , but not at any price .
however , we cannot accept this agreement .
we very much hope they will seize this opportunity .
the threat of terrorism is not getting smaller .
for behind all terrorists is an organisation which trained them , supplied them with explosives and financed them .
terrorism has to be well organised to survive , and for this it principally needs money .
we should make every effort to ensure that the final agreement guarantees the necessary protection of personal data .
when we are talking about security , political games should be set aside .
body scanners operation of intelligence services in the context of counter terrorism strategies debate 
we are talking about mistakes made in an attack that fortunately did not happen .
there are five conclusions .
secondly , detroit highlights the importance of collecting data , but also of integrating and analysing it .
in my opinion , the personality of suspected terrorists is a very significant factor in relation to this issue .
this brings us to the debate on information management .
we have the framework of the eu within which we can exchange information appropriately .
these matters are debated in the formal and informal council of transport ministers .
these studies will be available to the council and this house in the near future .
these considerations must be taken into account in our next debate .
my priority as transport commissioner is definitely the safety and security of passengers .
this is a major priority for our common transport policy and this is always extremely important .
the incident showed first of all the failure of intelligence , a failureto connect the dots.
aviation remains a target for terrorists .
we cannot ignore this fact .
aviation security must therefore be guaranteed by all appropriate means , in full compliance with fundamental rights .
some think that they are considerably better .
i intend to present to you in april a report on imaging technology and its use at eu airports .
this report will address the questions raised in the european parliament resolution of 200we need to look at these questions seriously .
to my mind , an eu framework would be better .
an eu framework guarantees uniform standards in relation both to security and to respect for individual rights .
as the minister just said , terrorists develop .
we must develop as well , and body scanners are only one element in this variety .
i look forward to your views and thank you for your attention .
member of the commission . mr president , this is the commission's new dual approach .
this will be the basis upon which I will decide how to move forward .
i look forward to bringing this evaluation to you and to discussing it with you .
the denver flight showed that recently .
this , of course , is a commitment that it still valid .
there can be no freedom without security and there can be no security without freedom .
we have to react to non conventional threats and to improve the detection of threats .
i will do so this year .
we also have the cbrn action plan proposed by the commission last june and agreed by the council .
this action plan consists of 130 measures .
we will also have to revise how we use our financial resources .
this might be by creating an internal security fund , which is foreseen in the stockholm programme .
we have to avoid our policies being perceived as ambiguous or as applying double standards .
you gave us a very hopeful prospect .
looking back , we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of europe .
we are taking positive action and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the public authorities .
the people who are responsible for security have done a good job over recent years .
i would also like to thank our partners .
now we must look to the future .
what will we be faced with over the next few years ?
in this respect , I have three specific requests or proposals .
the first concerns cooperation among the authorities in europe .
every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation .
these are wonderful words , but nothing has happened in practice .
once again nothing happened in toledo with regard to practical cooperation .
there is no lack of action this has been made clear in detroit .
what we are lacking is cooperation between the authorities .
after an interval of a few years , it is important to put it to the test .
thirdly , we have just had a discussion about swift .
therefore , the question arises as to whether we are self confident enough to evaluate it ourselves .
first of all , we must take a coordinated , harmonised european approach .
we need more security in this area .
the events in detroit and munich have shown that there are security loopholes .
they are already in place in the us , in the netherlands and in other countries .
however , this raises the issue of whether body scanners will really make air travel safer .
this is one of the crucial questions that we must ask ourselves .
there is , in fact , a whole series of questions relating to body scanners .
what type of technology is being used ?
what type of radiation do they emit ?
can they cause damage to health ?
what do they allow people to see ?
just a few green or red dots or the whole person who is being scanned ?
finally , can we ensure that the data is being protected ?
also , these scanners are expensive .
if we are going to install them , who will be paying ?
there are a lot of questions to be answered and we are in the process of doing this .
you also want to do this and present us with a solution .
whatever happens , we need a solution which covers the whole of europe .
we also need to take into consideration tel aviv and the possibility of using another method .
we need to search for the bombers and not the bombs .
these specifications covered privacy , data protection , human dignity , health and freedom of choice .
at heathrow airport in london , this equipment is being used without the element of freedom of choice .
the latest generation of scanners satisfy the requirements that parliament has laid down .
if such spots are seen , the passengers in question are checked separately on the spot .
the latest scanners also do not have any effect on health .
the radiation they give off is less than that from mobile phones .
what is more , the scanners are also user friendly .
that will therefore also make a difference to costs for air travellers .
however , mr president , the latest scanners are additional security tools .
this email spoke of thepost detroit era.
no surprise there .
each machine cost eur 250 000 .
it did not , unless it refers to the era of sheer effrontery .
european citizens also need to know that we in parliament have a responsibility .
yes , we do indeed need to investigate terrorism .
i am sorry to say that these are incorrect .
the idea that the terrorist threat has not diminished is debatable and should be debated here .
now we find ourselves debating the databases and police practices of the future .
is this where we want to end up ?
can there be any greater mockery of human rights ?
we are facing up to this challenge on both a technical and a parliamentary level .
i would like to say one thing first of all .
however , we can develop natural techniques that will allow us to come close to complete security asymptotically .
we need to take some fundamental rules into account , both outside and inside parliament .
of course , it is obvious that personal rights must be protected .
there are a number of factors to be taken into account in this area .
mr president , you said that there were three commissioners who are responsible here .
we are very happy about this .
may I quote the only one who is not here .
that is exactly the kind of statement we should be making at this early stage .
this is a serious fight .
i have been stopped many times at airports .
mr president , I want to talk about respect for the rule of law by intelligence services .
a ruling today by the uk court of appeal has blasted open the british government's attempt at secrecy .
in 2006 , I led the mep delegation from our temporary committee on extraordinary rendition and torture to london .
he owes me and , more importantly , the british and european public , an apology .
mr president , back to body scanners .
i remain of the view that any measure which increases security for the travelling public must be welcomed .
i fundamentally object to that policy .
some experts have already said that the explosives used would not have been detected by such scanners .
so much for body scanners .
eight years later , in 2008 , the figure had reached 16 000 people .
in comparison , 6 000 people die of aids every day .
what do these figures tell us ?
secondly , the war on terror has failed .
it has only succeeded in increasing the problem .
we must push forward with the development of this interface and it must be financed by the commission .
we should anticipate events , but we do not .
taking a decision on body scanners in airports is a responsibility that we cannot avoid , ladies and gentlemen .
we cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting .
once this is guaranteed , we must adopt decisions for the european union as a whole .
however , there are also three institutional elements .
the first is cosi , the standing committee on internal security .
fr mr president , one of the means of preventing terrorism is information .
is this really the case today ?
nothing is less certain .
do the us intelligence services keep their european counterparts up to date ?
a parliamentary supervisory body on the matter is urgently required .
this entails the creation of a parliamentary supervisory committee within the european parliament .
i wonder , and I ask parliament do we want a debate on terrorism ?
it seems that no one is willing to deal with the subject .
we talk here about the cooperation of the security forces .
we need to support our security forces with the equipment they need to prevent terrorism .
believe me , terrorism destroys lives and shatters communities .
what utter nonsense !
i hope that three of them will be resolved by the studies that the commission is carrying out .
i ask that they conclude them promptly and refer them to parliament .
firstly , is it necessary and effective ?
secondly , is it or is it not harmful to health ?
thirdly , does it or does it not violate the privacy and dignity of individuals ?
there are , however , other concerns .
initially we were told that it would be optional .
i have two questions concerning body scanners .
in terms of security , do these scanners make it possible today to really guarantee security conditions ?
mr president , terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation to achieve political ends .
those of us who value peace , freedom and democracy ought to be concerned about terrorism because it works .
sinn féin / ira now hold posts in the government of northern ireland .
they bombed , shot and murdered their way to success at the ballot box .
what better examples of successful terrorism are there than those of communism in russia , eastern europe and asia ?
china is still terrorised by the chinese communist party after 61 years of power .
no greater example of successful terrorism exists than that .
and , of course , the president of the european commission , mr barroso , is a former maoist .
no doubt future terrorists will find this all extremely encouraging .
some governments have legitimately started to test body scanners on more sensitive routes .
of course we must defend personal rights , but without preying on people's fears .
ladies and gentlemen , we now come to catch the eye .
these are the names I will call out .
i will simply stop the microphone after one minute .
i will not bang my gavel , I will not beg and I do not want to be misunderstood .
i shall call the speakers in the order that I have 
mr zasada
mr iacolino
mr matula
mr leichtfried
mr enciu
ms flašíková beňová
mr tannock
ms ernst
ms rivasi
and mr mölzer .
one minute each , and that is it .
apologies to the rest of you .
use of this type of equipment still leaves a series of unanswered questions .
what effect do the scanners have on the health of passengers who are scanned ?
how will protection of the images of people who are scanned be guaranteed ?
it is no longer possible for individual member states to do what they want .
this applies in particular to body scanners .
the public are less aware of the effects of terahertz radiation .
sk terrorism has no values , nor does it have any deeper meaning .
the only aim of terrorism is death .
death of civilians at the lowest possible cost .
this is perhaps the story of various suicide attackers .
instead , I argue we should bring on israeli style profiling of passengers .
we need to ask ourselves two questions .
we do not currently have any clear answers to this question .
i would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else .
the second question concerns the risks to health .
this is a long term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health .
no real assessments have been carried out in this area .
therefore , I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions .
indeed , we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations .
my question therefore concerns justification of the risks .
despite this , the usefulness of the various anti terrorism measures has never been called into question .
instead , every attack is followed by further restrictions on civil rights and liberties .
mr president , I have listened carefully to the speeches by all the groups and members on this topic .
we have heard some extremely interesting views , and I welcome them .
if we adopt measures that will undermine our principles , we are probably making a serious mistake .
europe has a strategy for its counter terrorism policy .
we have an important figure , a counter terrorism coordinator , whose speeches are very interesting .
that is why we are focusing our common efforts , as I said , on prevention .
we are also keen to ensure the correct exchange of information .
this has been emphasised in the house on various occasions .
that is the information that needs to be transmitted .
there have been significant improvements recently in the european union in that regard .
ideally , we will be able to decide on a common solution at european level .
however , there is little doubt that a common position on this matter would be extraordinarily helpful .
i believe these are the three topics that we need to examine .
once the reports are available , we will adopt a common position , which I believe is necessary .
mr president , I asked a direct question to the council and I would like an answer .
this is not the case .
terrorism develops and we , too , must use all technological developments to defend our citizens and passengers .
so do not demonise new technologies .
we will come with a report and then we will continue this discussion .
counter terrorism is an important tool for fighting terrorism .
i agree with certain members who have said that .
there are certainly measures for doing that .
this is totally natural .
we will do this .
we will also have to give full consideration to respect for fundamental rights .
so this is how this commission will work .
thank you very much for an important and very engaging debate .
terrorism remains a high level threat in the european union .
the use of body scanners is a delicate issue .
i think that there are important factors which must be examined carefully before making a decision on this .
the european commission is due to produce three studies on the use and effects of body scanners .
i have always taken the stand that it is a question of priorities .
it is a question whether passengers are prepared to sacrifice their discomfort for their safety .
civil liberty groups have the duty to weigh all new measures being advocated .
those proposing new measures such as body scanners have the duty to prove their necessity .
it is apparent that current procedures , in particular , body searches , are not sufficient .
it has been established that body scanners are more effective .
the problem is that they may offend passengersdignity .
therefore , this is the issue which has to be addressed .
many possibilities exist .
for instance , different body scanners for different genders manned by personnel of the same gender .
therefore , once we have evaluated the existing situation , we must continue our work in this sensitive area .
they have condemned the deportation of as an intolerable violation of press freedom .
we must find a way of protecting our citizens and preventing them from becoming the victims of terrorist acts .
body scanners may be one of the ways of strengthening security in airports and on board aeroplanes .
i await with great interest the study that the european commission will submit on this matter in march .
this is why these issues should be investigated in their overall context .
safety is a key issue in our lives it is the most important issue .
only the use of devices compliant with this set of requirements is acceptable to us .
in writing . we cannot wait for another catastrophe before acting to protect air passengers .
we need a pan european approach to the issue of scanners airport security needs to be uniform .
i eagerly await the conclusion of the commission report of the impact of body scanners .
it seems to me that this is not , however , a correct understanding of the matter .
if we give up part of our liberty in favour of security , will our security really be guaranteed ?
the information we are receiving about this makes us very sceptical .
history teaches us that in crisis situations , special services want to take the simplest route .
the terrorist threat has made us agree more readily to the restriction of our own freedom .
this system has proved its effectiveness over many years .
i totally agree with finding viable solutions for enhancing our citizenssecurity .
and when you dare to protest , they laugh in your face .
you would agree this is an abuse .
to fight terrorism effectively , we need coordinated action , including eu rules on scanners .
a decision on compulsory use of scanning equipment must be made .
there is no point talking about it at all if the scans are to be voluntary .
for it is difficult to suppose that terrorists will agree to being scanned .
a very important question is , of course , the safety of the scanners for health .
the research should be coordinated by the european commission with the full cooperation of member states .
the scanners used must have a safety certificate allowing their use in all member states .
mr president , a new method of searching passengers has been introduced at some european airports .
alongside the current forms of security , full body scanners have been brought into use .
there are no clear regulations on the storage and protection of data collected by scanning .
situation in ukraine debate 
as you will be aware , a second round of presidential elections took place on sunday in ukraine .
it is important because a democratic ukraine will serve as an important example to its neighbours .
the statement issued by the high representative on monday expressed this sentiment .
it also congratulated the people of ukraine for their continued commitment to the democratic process .
it is clear that ukraine's democracy is continuing its process of consolidation .
this is a significant achievement .
most importantly , it demonstrates ukraine's attachment to european values .
elections have winners and losers .
preliminary election results show a very small gap between the two contestants .
we have already heard about possible challenges to the results in the courts .
some local court cases have already been initiated .
it is logical and legitimate that any possible problems are investigated .
every election is a demonstration of popular will .
it is also an opportunity for a new start .
it is now vital for ukraine to move forward .
ukraine has consistently held good elections , and has a vibrant civil society and free media .
regrettably , however , the overall reform process which is vital for ukraine has significantly slowed .
much more should have been done in the past years .
the weakness of ukraine's constitutional framework has also contributed to this .
this is also a precondition for the disbursement of possible eu macrofinancial assistance .
the eu's message to ukraine's leadership is consistent and clear now is the time to act .
we expect to see concrete steps forward .
it is in ukraine's own interest not just to please the international community .
this message was also already conveyed at the eu ukraine summit of 4 december 200action is needed at many levels .
we have many tools to do so .
through the european neighbourhood policy , we have the means to support ukraine's own reform efforts .
the eastern partnership has brought additional tools .
but our offer to ukraine is not a one way street .
we look forward to working with ukraine's new leadership to achieve our common goals .
madam president , commissioner , we are rather disappointed .
he is certainly responsible for the failure of the orange revolution .
i hope that these elections will bring new stability to ukraine .
instead , it causes us to watch ukraine with great concern .
mr füle , you have a specific responsibility relating to neighbourhood policy .
however , neighbourhood policy does not simply mean going on as before .
we must give them perspectives .
now to the matter in hand .
one of the rules of democracy is that you accept the result of the elections as it is .
the recent presidential elections can be seen as another step in the consolidation of democracy .
there is a saying that a revolution devours its own children .
this is true , but ukraine remains a state even after these elections .
it still has its multi party system , and this is mainly thanks to the orange revolution .
and all of this is very important .
it is a crucial precondition for bilateral and multilateral cooperation that ukraine's government continues to implement its objectives .
we have to continue talks on the association agreement between ukraine and the european union .
in recent times , the tempo has been slowing , and we must speed it up again .
we also have to put a more concrete content into energy and environmental cooperation .
we hope that ukraine turns round these shortcomings .
madam president , first of all , I would like to pick up on what mr brok said .
none of the citizens whom I met had great expectations of this election .
the internal failings in ukraine are mirrored by failings in the european strategy .
we must not take this lightly any longer .
gas is one subject which always causes a great deal of consternation .
i only need to mention sevastopol , where we are facing a major conflict .
we cannot simply let things go on as they have before .
you have taken on a significant responsibility in this area .
she can stand up for her supposed rights .
the close election result reflects the fact that the country is split into two camps .
given the close result , both camps will have to make compromises .
i share mrs harmsregret , here , that mrs ashton is not with us today .
in this sense , mr brok is not right when he says the orange revolution lost .
it won , because it was all about having rules from which everyone could benefit .
however , this is good this is how it should be .
have we answered that question ?
can far reaching reforms be carried out in a post communist country without that promise ?
can we encourage people to make sacrifices if we tell them they will always be kept waiting outside ?
to say that is a great opportunity for the new commissioner , mr füle .
mrs ashton has not come , today .
commissioner , be bold and be the first person who starts to say that there is room .
this will be of great help to the ukrainians .
this must not just be said to the elite , to businesspeople or to students .
it is an opportunity for you , too , mr füle .
say this clearly , and you will go down in history .
everyone must feel that they have an opportunity .
we need to say very clearly the door to europe is open for ukraine .
someone must , at last , after these five years , say it .
madam president , ukraine's recent elections have shown that the country is a functioning democracy .
the new president will be governing in the face of robust opposition and free media .
the european union must respond with clear signals welcoming both trends .
at the same time , ukraine needs to speed up its reforms .
if such progress is made , the eu must consider extending a promise of membership to ukraine .
in the meantime , we should encourage and do much more for integration at the grassroots level .
we must ensure the greatest possible flow of people across our frontiers with ukraine .
after the elections in ukraine , something will change .
a new openness to ukraine is needed from the european union .
let us not be motivated by personal ambitions .
however , let us not push the new president of ukraine into the arms of moscow .
ukraine is going to be a partner from whom much will be expected .
ukraine is going to be a partner who should be treated with goodwill .
the eastern partnership and euronest initiative offer a suitable framework for this .
the question is whether the ukraine can consolidate democracy internally .
this means establishing democratic norms and protecting human rights .
this is not solely the fault of their political elite .
it is true that they were too consumed with conflicts of power and influence .
many reforms were never implemented , and many never left the drawing board .
it suggests that there are unworthy and undesirable intentions behind it .
what would we expect from the eu ?
solidarity .
commissioner , you said that we expect energetic and purposeful action from ukraine's new president and new administration .
however , we should say something to the european union .
the european union must give ukraine an alternative european vision .
perhaps these presidential elections will help bring the country out of political stalemate and will provide more stability .
ukraine is still deciding which model of civilisation it should subscribe to .
should the country cooperate with the east or choose integration in europe ?
the people of ukraine have expressed their will to choose the leader of their country .
ukraine is a european country which must have the right to take decisions on europe .
sl commissioner , your report on ukraine today was very clear .
basically , the close contest has exposed how complicated this country is .
attaching labels to this country or spreading any kind of prejudice about it would be a negative thing .
he will content himself , instead , with an fta and a visa liberalisation regime .
it probably will not happen but , if it does , it must be peaceful and by consensus .
it is encouraging that this was the result of a fair election .
otherwise , the results of the next elections will already have been decided .
the eu must provide close support and assistance for this stabilisation process .
again , I apologise to all those to whom I could not give the opportunity to speak .
i am sure it is a subject to which we will return again .
as I said at the beginning , ukraine matters .
it remains a partner of strategic importance for the european union , and a leader in the region .
eu ukraine relations have deepened considerably in the past years .
i firmly believe that this dynamic should continue in the future .
that will encourage me to be even braver .
the vote will take place during the second part session in february .
more than half a million ethnic romanians live in this country .
the authorities in kiev have hitherto shown them little interest in terms of guaranteeing basic rights .
ukraine is currently faced with two value systems .
another group of citizens look at european integration with distrust .
after the presidential elections , a new chapter begins in relations between the eu and ukraine .
one of the most important areas of cooperation will be the issue of energy supply .
furthermore , efforts aimed at expanding storage capacity are also worth supporting .
the european parliament is expected to adopt the new gas supply regulation for the eu in spring .
this regulation will require member states to approve coordinated action plans in the event of gas supply disruptions .
in writing . ukraine continues to be crucial for the stability and democratic development of europe .
but we cannot look away from the responsibility of european union policies toward ukraine since 200the eu has not been eager to offer ukraine the prospect of eu membership .
this will remain the eu's responsibility .
now we need to make maximum use of the eastern partnership .
europe should consider making a specific proposal to include ukraine in european structures .
i hope that the new president will take into account the pro european direction expressed by the majority of ukrainians .
election promises must be fulfilled .
ukraine is a european state and shares all of europe's cultural values .
for example , there is a romanian speaking minority in ukraine numbering more than 410 000 .
i am pleased that the ukrainian elections last sunday passed off well .
it is also in our interest that relations between ukraine and russia are consolidated .
question time council 
the next item is question time b7 0006 / 2010 .
subject creating an internal energy market
in creating an internal energy market , the community has undertaken to speak with one voice .
madam president , the internal energy market and security of energy supply are inextricably linked .
lt minister , once again , I would like to thank you for your thoughts and answer .
the member states concerned should also act as one on this matter .
an internal energy market needs better interconnection between national power networks .
the baltic states have been hit very hard by the economic crisis .
i am thinking in particular of price volatility .
subject development approaches , objectives and actions under the eu's 2020 sustainable development strategy
ro we also now have comments which have come from the stakeholders .
the public consultation about the eu 2020 strategy on the commission website is over .
you mentioned the case of spain which indeed has suffered greatly in the property sector .
subject freedom of religion in china
i can assure you , mr posselt , that religious freedom forms an integral part of those criteria .
de mr garrido , thank you very much for your detailed answer .
i have two brief additional questions .
firstly , when will you next have the opportunity to discuss these matters with china ?
the council has investigated these cases and has brought them to the attention of the chinese authorities .
a lot done a lot more to do .
it is very carefully phrased .
religious beliefis guaranteed , but what about practice ?
what constitutesnormal religious activities?
a lot done , but an awful lot more to do so keep up the good work .
de thank you for your accurate answers , mr garrido .
subject cia secret prisons and flights
a number of other trials are under way , notably in poland and the uk .
what measures will it propose to ensure that these circumstances are not repeated in the future ?
this continues to be our opinion .
pt madam president , minister , thank you for your response .
in fact , however , even after that statement in july , there were new discoveries .
the obama administration merely declared that it was disappointed with the decision by the italian court .
we will continue to act and develop along these lines .
three years ago , a special parliamentary commission was appointed on guantánamo .
the european council also worked on this matter , and now keeps coming back to it .
i agree with the points made by the last speakers .
in this respect , I believe that the role of the press is an absolutely vital one .
question time is closed .					
the sitting was suspended at 19.25 and resumed at 21.00 
effects of the economic crisis on world trade debate 
the effects of the crisis on world trade indicate a possible 10 % decline in 200this represents the biggest such contraction since the second world war brought on by the collapse in global demand .
keeping international trade flowing is vital for the eu and other exports oriented countries .
in this case , eu industry needs to retarget its export markets and possibly the future of its products .
what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to enable eu industry to become more competitive ?
these trade deficits have contributed to global imbalances that are at the root of the global economic crisis .
what strategy does the commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy ?
for example , we are seeing signs of economic recovery now , but levels of unemployment remain very high .
i suggest focusing in my initial reply on the contribution of trade policy to economic recovery .
by and large , only a few countries resorted to trade protectionism .
in order to maintain this , it is important to remain extremely vigilant .
external sources of growth will be crucial to eu economic recovery .
i therefore concur with you that european industry should target the new and fast growing emerging markets .
this will be a priority for me as trade commissioner .
this strategy will have an effective external dimension in which trade policy plays a key role .
but trade policy is about more than just competitiveness and growth .
it is also about projecting our values worldwide and it must also duly integrate the development dimension of trade .
promoting a strong contribution to development goals is already an important part of the eu's trade policy .
the current multilateral negotiations are a development round .
we have bilateral and regional negotiations with developing countries and autonomous preferences in favour of these countries .
madam president , I , too , would like to start by welcoming the commissioner .
it is a pleasure to see you here .
you have an important task ahead of you .
a year ago , I was extremely concerned .
however , no trade war came about .
i think it is important to stop and reflect on why that was .
i would say that it is too early to declare the crisis over .
that is not necessarily protectionism , but at times , they are only a hair's breadth away .
it is , in any event , an expression of a mercantilism that I believe to be damaging .
that would amount to considered action and leadership on our part .
we in parliament need to reflect on that too .
i would like to return to these ideas .
property and tourism are sectors which have been particularly affected by this .
this has an extremely powerful effect on employment .
however , a number of issues remain on the agenda , some of which have already been mentioned .
what commercial policy instruments does the european union have available to tackle the financial crisis and its repercussions ?
i am counting exclusively on this europe 2020 strategy to find these answers .
madam president , commissioner , thank you for having put the fantasy of crisis related protectionism into its proper context .
now , I almost want to reverse the issue .
in the same way , we keep being told that liberalising trade with china is good for us .
until we define these choices , we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure .
this , of course , is intended to produce a better standard of living .
the problems begin when the economy slows down , market indices fall sharply and problems start with unemployment .
this is the other side of the coin .
this can be seen clearly in the current situation .
i think the present crisis will be a test for all of us .
i am thinking principally , here , about countries belonging to the european union .
we must also use our strengths advanced technologies and human capital . 
this crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets .
but what does the commission do ?
that , concretely , is the prescription of the commission .
therefore , the tens of thousands of greek workers who marched yesterday were absolutely right .
we need to replace it with a system of human solidarity , based on the values of democratic socialism .
last year , the uk economy contracted 4.8 % .
so did italy's .
the german economy contracted 5 % and eu trade much more so .
now , one prerequisite for a competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy is to have a flexible work force .
so what has the eu done to bring this about ?
and , incidentally , it is by having a flexible workforce that you raise people out of poverty .
the eu economic crisis reveals that the eu has , as it were , no bathing costume .
hu I would like to talk about two issues the trade deficit and co2 emissions .
this is a three fold increase in 4 years .
this means that the consumption of each european citizen exceeded produced value by eur 500 .
such a large trade deficit and a consumption that exceeds production to such an extent are not sustainable .
however , this would incur a much higher social cost .
the current events in greece illustrate this .
if we do not reduce energy consumption , there is a danger that again and again . 
if you believe the commission , trade dropped by 10 % in 200if you believe the imf , it dropped by 12.3 % in 200 sv madam president , our continent is a rich one .
the eu must shoulder a particular responsibility for maintaining free and fair trade .
developing countries are particularly vulnerable when their exports fall and they have problems obtaining bank financing .
for the acp countries , for example , trade in goods represents 50 % of their trade .
these countries are thus extremely sensitive to crises .
a 1 % drop in growth results in 20 million people falling into poverty .
it is unreasonable for the rich eu to force out poor farms in africa through competition .
the eu can and must act as a beacon for the liberalisation of world trade .
globalisation and international trade are fundamentally positive .
protectionism is an evil and has always been an evil .
many farms stopped growing sugar beet , we increased unemployment and did not achieve any social or economic benefits .
i think that during the crisis , we should give strong protection to our economy and our producers .
we should act in a similar way on many other matters .
the euro's stability is of paramount importance to the trust of our trade partners .
and it is these countries , the developing countries , which need open markets that can receive their products .
at the same time , we must not overlook the dynamic increase in exports by certain emerging economies .
however , protectionism further hurts international trade and the eu's interests directly .
another instance which may be recalled is the temporary tariff on drugs that russia has imposed on eu exporters .
as a consequence , a total of 30 % of the eu's product lines have seen increased tariffs .
in my country , there is a saying that attack is the best form of defence .
should we not make more proactive use of our global europe strategy and forcefully implement the points it contains ?
is it not now the right time to address our interests proactively instead of simply preventing protectionism ?
i think we should take the logical step of negotiating free trade agreements quickly .
however , what has happened with regard to india , canada , colombia and peru ?
many other members have referred to the developing countries .
i look forward to hearing your answer , mr de gucht .
at the same time , as our relative size decreases , our negotiating power decreases as well .
time is working against us , even more than before as a result of the crisis .
how does the us rate the importance of these relations ?
the european union must first of all find a happy medium between ultra free trade and protectionism .
to my mind , this third way must be embodied by the creation of a fair trade framework .
how can this be achieved ?
i would like to propose looking at the differences between these two guiding principles in three areas .
is it good for the environment that goods are delivered from great distances ?
ro I would like to congratulate the commissioner on his new appointment .
a new theory came into being they were too big to fail .
no banker should be getting more than the prime minister of his country , and we should work towards .
the advantages of free trade in a global economy ought not to need explaining to anyone . 
we are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well known liberal on the commission .
we must fight against any protectionist tendencies .
we are also facing a new world order .
therefore , I call on the commission to develop a new strategy for world trade .
mr de gucht , fortunately you are also responsible for the transatlantic economic council tec .
i would be very grateful if you could devote your attention to the tec .
i have only two or three minutes if I understand rightly .
having said this , let me start with a general remark .
i really do not believe that protectionism is a solution .
the idea that we could export without importing is completely false and contradictory to the facts .
that brings me to the origins of the crisis we are going through .
hopefully , the major part is behind us .
i think that is the only good response .
also , within asia , the other asian countries are facing very fierce competition from china .
so what we should do is become stronger ourselves .
we should work on that , but , having said this , it is not easy at all .
first of all , I must say that I like the name robin hood much better than tobin .
being a member state of the european union also implies some obligations .
at the same time , these countries have also been hit hard by the credit crunch .
this is the point at which we must start .
secondly , we need regulations for the companies that have suffered damage as a result of the crisis .
some countries have resorted to protectionist practices , while others are trying to liberalise trade .
does the european commission , when taking anti crisis measures , take these into account ?
eu south korea free trade agreement debate 
that is a very good thing .
all of these sectors and many others hope to gain major benefits from the agreement .
however , the main protests are coming from the car industry .
these terms are reciprocity , european interest , the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers .
how can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries ?
we all welcomed the birth of the new europe in lisbon with hope .
europe cannot however , fail to take responsibility for european interests in the world , particularly today .
the agreement with korea actually legitimises pass through financing with china which , until now , was illegal .
free and fair trade forms the basis for europe's prosperity .
we must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies .
this may lead to one sided cost benefits for south korean industry .
however , we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved .
the system must be applicable in practice .
for this reason , a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force .
i know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has .
in our opinion , at least , this should be included .
thank you , commissioner , for your points of view on the previous debate .
simplification of certification procedures , transparency and price predictability are all things that will benefit the consumer .
the inclusion of duty drawback clauses has been a concern for many of us , as I mentioned .
the commission has assured us that korea is actively liberalising its import regime .
the level of duties that korea can refund under the duty drawback are gradually being reduced .
the negotiators are convinced that the economic relevance of the duty drawback will therefore diminish over time .
what evidence does the commission have to support this argument ?
after more than two years of negotiations , the free trade agreement was initialled on 15 october last year .
throughout the negotiating process , the commission remained in close contact with parliament .
in this respect , the commission welcomes the resolution on korea voted by parliament in december 200many of the issues raised in this resolution have been addressed in the free trade agreement .
the fta is currently being translated .
the objective is to sign the agreement in april .
in this case , the fta would require the ratification of all member states before formally entering into force .
the provisional application is decided by the council on a proposal by the commission .
it is of great importance that we apply the agreement as soon as is feasible .
the economic benefits of the fta are mostly in the eu's favour .
with regard to intellectual property rights , the fta contains ambitious commitments going beyond wto rules .
these changes go in the direction of simplification , thus implementing a specific request by the european parliament .
at the same time , strict rules have been maintained for all sensitive sectors .
the commission has paid particular attention to creating a new market access opportunity in korea for european fruit and vegetables .
obviously , the fta also opens the eu market to korean products .
to protect our industry against import increases causing or threatening injury , the fta contains an effective safeguard mechanism .
this safeguard clause can be invoked from the entry into force of the fta .
thus , maintaining it in the fta does not accrue any new benefit .
to address such situations , the fta contains an efficient and rapid dispute settlement mechanism .
commissioner , first of , I would like to wish you the best of luck in your new role .
we find ourselves in economically tricky times , but we know that you are not afraid of them .
mr caspary also made this point .
just take a look at the figures , commissioner .
for every car that we export to south korea from europe , 15 come the other way .
this forthcoming free trade agreement with south korea is the direct cause of this decision .
the numbers and the trends are much too alarming .
firstly , we said in my report that we needed much better access to the korean agricultural market .
and they are not , as one of my colleagues indicated , insignificant .
we called for non tariff barriers to be tackled and this will be of particular benefit to the automobile industry .
we wanted improved trade in environmental goods .
all of these things , parliament asked for .
it would be ludicrous and perverse for us to turn our back on them , having achieved them .
well , of course it is not .
yes .
is it a good deal for korea ?
yes .
is it a good deal , potentially , for the world economy ?
yes .
so we should not shilly shally on this we should get on and sign it .
it is almost as though the commission were tempted to close the deal at any cost .
these two principles will soon constitute a precedent for our other trade partners .
every european citizen expects all of us , commission and parliament , to demonstrate political sensitivity .
on the other hand , with this agreement , we risk introducing subsidies for korean exports .
mr president , as you said , this agreement breaks new ground .
it breaks new ground , but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it .
just what do these figures mean , however ?
i am an elected representative for the west of france region , and more specifically for brittany .
we are continually told that europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change .
you have talked about the lisbon strategy , the green economy and innovation .
i do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged .
there will be enormous benefit to both europe and korea on the signing of this deal .
i know there are concerns and I have listened to those concerns .
we have heard them here tonight about the car industry .
so we must look to the opportunities and take them , and not the negatives .
so we must do all we can to break down the barriers that are in that particular region .
the agreement will show our support for progress .
specifically , how quickly will we be able to utilise this mechanism in the case of serious market disruption ?
these are consequences of the gradual liberalisation of international trade which their advocates cannot ignore .
these complaints give rise to questions that continue to go unanswered .
what defence mechanisms and safeguards are there against aggressive exports ?
when and how will we have a way of effectively tackling the relocation of businesses ?
what are the key elements of this programme ?
commissioner , fair economic relations must be established as a matter of urgency .
mr president , I do not see this in the same way as the previous speaker .
i actually welcome the free trade agreement with south korea .
the country is now the world's eleventh largest economy and the eu's fourth largest trading partner .
south korea is an important ally in a strategically important area .
in competitive terms , china has an almost inexhaustible resource in the form of cheap labour .
consequently , china is also the country's main trade competitor .
this free trade agreement will , as has been mentioned , remove tariffs worth eur 1.6 billion a year .
mr president , during the last few months , the eu has experienced several changes and transitions .
we have had three commissioners on international trade , two eu council presidents and the lisbon treaty .
the strongest arguments were mainly in the area of ddb safeguards and non tariff barriers .
even the usa has shelved its fta with south korea partly because of similar objections from the car industry .
this is the first major fta .
this is a template . we need to do it right .
there must be a level playing field for both parties .
please do not get me wrong .
i am a strong proponent of ftas .
employees in the eu deserve better .
we did not think that events would prove us right so quickly .
allow me to spot a connection there .
we expect answers from you today , commissioner .
where does this figure come from ?
on what study is it based ?
leaving aside the expected positive effects , however , have the negative effects also been taken into account ?
the commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement .
the proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses .
thank you , mr arif , but the interpreters are still having problems keeping up with you .
they keep signalling to me to tell me that they cannot keep up with you .
therefore , only you yourself and the french speakers in the house are following what you are saying .
also , the european trade unions federation has criticised this free trade agreement .
the same korean trade investment promotion agency has calculated this advantage as at least eur 1 300 per car .
therefore , does the new commission consider this free trade agreement a fair trade agreement ?
we must not be pressurised into acting too quickly .
numerous branches of industry , including many from poland , are complaining about this agreement .
therefore , it is my conviction that we should act as follows .
i expect the commission to produce a very comprehensive analysis of the consequences of bringing this agreement into force .
secondly , this treaty involves only one country , so it is a bilateral agreement .
what is the reason for this two year time lapse commissioner ?
i would also like to receive more details regarding any updates on this aspect you mentioned .
the labour clauses in the contract are good , but they do not go far enough .
the case of opel in antwerp has been mentioned several times .
who will benefit from this ?
is it possible that this is an advance effect of the free trade agreement ?
another sector with problems which has not received as much attention is the shipbuilding industry .
question on the basis of rule 149 8 of the rules of procedure 
we will widen this and use it even more in the future .
the item is hereby closed .
the new legislative framework on the european citizensinitiative is undoubtedly welcome .
there had long been a case for citizens to have access to such an instrument .
this is the only way that the eu will successfully move closer to its citizens and become more democratic .
the treaty of lisbon gives the citizens of the european union the right to propose a legislative initiative .
the citizens of the european union eagerly await this .
the european citizensinitiative is mainly about greater involvement of the citizens in creating european law .
the organisers of initiatives must be publicly responsible for transparency concerning the financing of the campaign to collect signatures .
those votes reflected a noticeable lack of communication between the european union and its citizens .
the commission received as few as 159 responses from individuals .
however , we must make sure that guarantees against abuses are met .
it should be simple , understandable and easily accessible .
in this way , the work put into its preparation and the effort invested will not be wasted .
situation in tibet debate 
the next item is the commission's statement on the situation in tibet .
it is evident that differences with china on tibet remain .
the eu position does not leave any room for misinterpretation .
therefore , let me stress the eu respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of china , including tibet .
we respect theone chinapolicy .
the dialogue should also address the participation of all tibetans in decision making .
for the eu , tibet is a human rights issue .
we welcome that the tibetan side has reiterated its firm commitment not to seek separation or independence .
from our side , I can guarantee the eu's wholehearted support to such a process .
finally , president obama recently met with the dalai lama in the white house .
we look forward to seeing baroness ashton inviting the dalai lama and meeting him in brussels .
in other words , we defend human rights and we also defend dialogue , meeting and agreement .
mr lópez garrido's presence in this house to talk about all matters is almost superhuman .
we must not give up .
china's shoulders are broad enough to enable it do so .
we are also supporting as is mrs andrikien the creation of a coordinator for tibet .
this is a battle for freedom which therefore concerns the identity of our continent .
they did not even listen to what mrs andrikienwas saying .
this is not true .
there must be no repeat of this .
it would appear that china does not want anything from the talks .
china wants to continue to violate tibetan cultural , religious and language rights .
we cannot accept cultural genocide of this sort .
a month ago , I went to dharamsala and I met the dalai lama .
i was convinced that I had to propose in parliament that we should discuss the situation in tibet .
despite this , the claims persist .
i am calling on the european union to condemn these remarks and raise the matter with china .
if the european union is not bold enough to defend tibet , not many others will .
we need to keep this matter alive in the european parliament .
reference was also made here to the fact that we need a special representative for tibet .
we have all kinds of special representatives .
uighur jihadists have also exploited recent unrest in tibet to foment their own violence against the chinese government .
this means that the commission recognises china's right to occupy tibet , which is a very serious matter .
the european parliament should also listen to the tibetan community .
events push us towards making some decisions in this house .
this week , google has abandoned china .
on the other hand , we cannot say that the situation is good .
tibetans are forbidden from doing anything to rescue their own culture , identity and religion .
the chinese authorities say that the dalai lama is a private person .
today , the 21st meeting of the tibetan task force for sino tibetan negotiations begins in dharamsala .
this is sad , indeed .
it is clear that the only lasting solution would be autonomy , and indeed an expanded , true autonomy .
it is not enough to formulate criticisms .
it would be good if the commission , ms catherine ashton and the council thought this through .
nor was it ever debated in the council of foreign ministers .
therefore , in order for us to succeed , criticism on the matter of tibet is not enough .
we also need a conception and mediation .
after all , tibet is also an important challenge .
we may agree or disagree on tibet , but , really , mrs ashton should be here .
today , mrs ashton is like pontius pilate , who washed his hands .
this is embarrassing .
ro mr kaczmarek spoke earlier about the protests in 200national security cannot be used as grounds for abolishing fundamental civil rights .
if we fail to adopt such a position , we know what happens .
we have seen it in the past where chinese communist leaders try to intimidate eu member states individually .
i believe that this issue must be dealt with during summit meetings .
i agree with the high representative in this regard .
what is the european union's reaction to the very events which we are talking about at the moment ?
mr šefčovič , you said you are appealing to both sides for dialogue .
was that a joke ?
do you really mean to appeal to the representatives of tibet for that dialogue ?
i was under the impression that they are willing for this .
madam president , tibet and its cultural heritage is our common treasure .
sadly , this is not the case .
this can be prevented only by granting them a genuine autonomous status .
i would note , commissioner , your statement that tibet is our legitimate concern .
china can become truly great only by showing respect towards its minorities .
i know personally what a godless and materialistic communist regime is capable of .
the global public cannot remain silent .
i myself am a member of the friends of tibet group in the european parliament .
i appeal to the commission not to forget this hard pressed group of people in its programmes .
a hypocrite who is dependent on something on those cheap goods from china .
i am referring to the appointment of a special coordinator for tibet .
let us do this .
let us do it now .
i therefore disagree with those who think that this issuewas not of concern.
we in the european union cannot go on putting up with this game , far less fuel it .
we must also be clear in this respect .
otherwise , nothing will be credible in terms of human rights .
madam president , on 10 march , we celebrated the 51st anniversary of the popular uprising in tibet .
we europeans keep learning from his holiness , the dalai lama .
even you , commissioner , cannot render international law null and void .
i believe this to be a concern that really pulls on the heart strings of every european citizen .
we are very quick to judge small countries that commit transgressions .
we react strongly , and we pass our judgment on small countries very quickly .
we tread on eggshells , both politically and diplomatically .
we are likewise unable to put pressure on china through millions in development aid .
i therefore expect the high representative .
sl I am one of the few who recently had an opportunity to visit tibet .
rivers have been polluted and motorways which blot the tibetan landscape have appeared .
however , there is some progress under way in tibet .
moreover , our discussion has underlined the necessity for both parties to promptly resume dialogues .
dozens of civilians were killed and several hundred were wounded .
the results of these efforts are still not satisfactory .
we have , doubtless , not even heard about many similar incidents .
this would be followed by specific action and , I hope , visible results .
the media , today , are full of information about china .
in this context , the media have , recently , also been writing about tibet .
however , can his strategy be successful ?
economic interests cannot be made a reason to forget the persecuted and the suffering .
since that time , tibetans have not been allowed to commemorate that day freely .
in eastern europe , where I come from , the story is a familiar one .
however , what we are talking about here is more than that .
the next item is the one minute speeches in accordance with rule 1rule 150 states that we may spend a maximum of 30 minutes on this item .
we had more than 74 requests to speak under this item .
that will clearly not be possible .
thirty minutes and 74 speakers for one minute will simply not work .
all of those who have not been granted speaking time were informed of this in advance by e mail .
therefore , they do not need to be here to wait in vain for their speaking time .
this was the only possible way to enable the debate to proceed in an orderly manner .
therefore , those who have been granted speaking time can now begin straight away .
we all know how sudan has suffered under his rule of violence .
it is difficult to say how free the election will be .
on monday , al bashir threatened to expel the international election observers .
he said that if they interfere in sudan's affairs , he would cut their fingers off .
we know that sudan is a country in need .
it is my hope that the election in sudan will create the conditions for a .
in my opinion , governments that have been unable to resolve unemployment stabilisation problems should not receive praise .
italian citizens have come up with theclean parliamentprogramme .
would it not be better to improve the services provided in biarritz by introducing non polluting forms of transport ?
i should like to know which measures the president is going to take with regard to this extension .
mr zuev was killed about a week ago in kaliningrad .
he was a well known journalist and blogger .
this is not the first case of a journalist being killed in russia .
since the year 2000 , there have been at least a dozen such cases .
in our dialogue with russia , we should always draw attention to this .
the bill of indictment states that the company has been involved in a long term bribery process .
as a result , apart from the financial crisis , we also have a moral crisis .
greece's problem is mainly political .
the president noted that there was a problem with the microphone 
it has worn down the resistance of greek society and the economic strength of the greeks .
as I said , its problem is mainly political .
we are not asking for money from any european citizens .
for seven months , there was anice age.
apart from sanctions , there was also a result .
if we remember this , we will have an excellent future , with safe and pure food originating here .
de madam president , many thanks once again to the rapporteur for his excellent report .
as a result , they play an important part in the development of rural areas within the european union .
the european union's agricultural products already meet high quality standards .
european standards have a global reputation for being very high .
this will be an incentive for producers to focus more on quality and food safety .
consumers have a right to enjoy agricultural products in the eu without concern and without compunction .
the purpose of the european union is not to be concerned about the curvature of cucumbers .
the same applies to the size of pizzas .
i would seriously warn against overregulation here .
if we want regional economic cycles , we need to focus on quality and not on degrees of curvature .
therefore , let us focus on quality and not packaging units .
ro let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur for tackling this issue of agricultural product quality .
the demands of the market are diverse and are increasing all the time .
faced with these new commercial challenges , the european farmer's main asset is quality .
however , there are a few aspects capable of enhancing quality .
that is why efforts are being made to safeguard them , including with labelling .
ro the agricultural product quality policy may provide a solution for many farmers .
against this backdrop , the scottà report is welcome , as is the package announced by commissioner cioloş .
an agricultural product quality policy and a reduction in the european agriculture budget are two incompatible ideas .
quality logos should , in principle , be viewed as beneficial if they are voluntary .
this robs producers and processors of their entrepreneurial freedom and also narrows the choice for consumers .
we need to be careful that good intentions do not descend into excessive bureaucracy .
as was rightly emphasised in the report , this has to change .
de madam president , the control of foodstuffs is a utopian fantasy .
the pressure for control and the consequences are , too , it seems .
we are thus in a right old stew !
we have seen the result of this recently in the listeria contaminated cheese scandal .
they are completely overwhelmed by the labelling jungle .
quality conscious customers are prepared to pay more for high quality foods .
the question is for how long , if rogue traders are also operating in this area .
you are right about that .
the designationmountain produceis therefore particularly important .
i would like to address two points .
however , producers want and need these rules .
we should take that into account in our debate and also in the vote tomorrow .
it is important that information on the quality of goods reaches the consumer .
we know that every product allowed on to the market must meet minimum standards .
consumers must know what they are buying and for what they are paying .
i would like to point out the key importance of improving designations of origin for foods .
every agricultural product in the eu must be clearly labelled with the origin of the raw materials .
consumers must not be duped by fraudulent labelling .
take china , for example .
imported seeds arrive in austria and then the so calledpressed seed oilis sold there .
in my view , a protected designation of origin and geographical indication system must be implemented .
food quality and safety are among the main challenges that we must resolve in the future
it is therefore not my intention to merge for the sake of it .
we therefore have to see which is the best way to successfully differentiate our products from the others .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen .
i should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land .
the european parliament will continue to fight for the protection of both farmers and consumers .
i am pleased to note the recognition of this indication .
market globalisation and the economic and financial crisis that has struck europe have not spared the agricultural sector .
to emerge from this , we need to focus on the quality and safety of our produce .
the agricultural product quality policy is not a static policy , separate from the other policies connected with agriculture .
g20 labour and employment ministers meeting washington , 20 / 21 april debate 
these figures speak for themselves .
indeed , the current crisis highlighted the most painful weaknesses of our increasingly interconnected global economy .
there is now a clear consensus on the need for global actions to solve global problems .
accordingly , the g20 leaders agreed to build an employment oriented framework for future economic growth .
this is all very welcome .
this unprecedented meeting will take place in washington dc on 20 and 21 april .
the commission and the spanish presidency will also participate .
social partnersinvolvement can bring tremendous added value .
the commission is ready to share this experience with the european union's international partners .
the commission will keep parliament informed about the progress made at the washington dc meeting .
this is a necessity , because there can be no social integration without integration via the workplace .
this meeting we are having today owes much to the chair of the committee on employment , mrs berès .
an act of god prevents her from being here today .
i am going to speak on behalf of us both .
it is not enough to regulate financial products we must get to the very bottom of the wrongdoing .
a dangerous game is being played between ministers for finance and ministers for employment and social affairs .
the commission praises our fiscal discipline but we are haemorrhaging jobs .
we are balancing the books but our workers are paying the price .
it is time to put an end to the regression of social and labour rights that we are seeing .
without the creation of new jobs with rights , there can be no way out of this crisis .
we know that this will have long term social as well as political consequences .
around the world , this goes hand in hand with extremism , which poses a long term threat as well .
however , I believe that even this is more than anything we have done in the past .
madam president , as we are all saying , the financial crisis has hit ordinary people very hard .
i just hope we do have those positive outcomes .
we know there is record unemployment in many countries across the world .
we have got to look at the real way of getting people into work into real jobs .
training programmes , for instance , have to be adequate to actually cover the needs at the moment .
work has been done in those other countries , so why are we not learning from them ?
we must make sure the core ilo conventions are actually implemented .
we must make sure the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities is implemented .
we must make sure that those who are not protected at the moment are protected in the future .
creating jobs must be a priority for europe .
realistic , specific , quantifiable targets , both long term and immediate , urgently need to be set .
we urgently need to be able to safeguard decent work for the citizens of europe .
we urgently need to be able to safeguard the employment and pension rights of workers .
we are close to forgetting the obvious that work is a lever for growth .
this is what will create the conditions for a sustainable recovery that provides a wealth of jobs .
social progress is a prerequisite for ending the economic crisis , not the other way around .
small and medium sized enterprises are shutting down en masse .
the number of long term unemployed is also growing constantly .
this week , in my country , lithuania , 300 000 people were registered unemployed .
my country has never experienced this before in the 20 years since it became independent .
therefore , I hope that such concrete decisions are taken at this meeting .
it is a major step forward that labour ministers are meeting in the g20 context .
the banks have been recapitalised and financial stability has enjoyed priority .
now we have to prioritise job creation .
this is a sound standard for us in moving forward on employment and social relations .
unfortunately , a failure to recognise this reality is evident in the current eu 2020 strategy .
we cannot go back to the extremes of the days of rampant capitalism the world of oliver twists !
otherwise , the eu 2020 strategy , just like the lisbon strategy , will end in failure .
fight against tuberculosis debate 
the next item is the statement from the commission on the fight against tuberculosis .
however , for too long , we have mistakenly lowered the guard against tuberculosis .
this amounts to about 16 deaths a day .
this is simply unacceptable and requires action by all concerned sectors and stakeholders .
it is unacceptable because tuberculosis is a preventable and curable disease that should not lead to such dramatic consequences .
the commission has launched a number of initiatives over the past years to strengthen capacities to tackle tuberculosis .
in 2000 , tuberculosis was included in the list of priority diseases under eu wide surveillance .
this has improved our shared knowledge and monitoring of the epidemiological situation .
since 2002 , more than eur 124 million has been allocated to these efforts .
but , as tuberculosis is not constrained by borders , we have to support countries beyond the european union .
however , the commission cannot succeed in this challenge alone .
tuberculosis is the seventh most common cause of death in the world .
globally , there were 9.4 million new cases of tuberculosis in 2008 and 1.8 million deaths .
a person is infected by tuberculosis somewhere in the world every second .
ultimately , we are the european union and our strength lies in unity .
sv that is what ban ki moon said today , on world tuberculosis day .
he is right , of course .
however , as the commission pointed out , people in europe are also dying of tuberculosis .
mr president , medical progress has not yet overcome tuberculosis .
consequently , it is wrongly considered to be a disease that affects only poor countries .
this underestimates the way in which it is spreading , especially in central and eastern europe .
furthermore , the multiple resistant strains offer little hope of an end to this scourge in the short term .
the number of cases of tuberculosis has been decreasing within the eu .
this reduction is linked to the success of the national plan to fight tuberculosis .
in some countries , however , it has recently been shown that the disease is resurgent .
the various action plans promoted by the european commission are steps in the right direction .
i would like to highlight the partnership between europe and developing countries in carrying out clinical trials .
strengthening the role of clinical and scientific research is vital in the fight against tuberculosis .
i also call on you to encourage greater investment in scientific research in the fight against tuberculosis .
i took great pleasure and interest in listening to the speeches of the honourable members .
we are determined to achieve our targets in order to control the tuberculosis disease .
the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation short presentation 
the financial crisis added to this fragile situation in which these countries found themselves .
in fact , all areas of activity in these countries have been damaged .
economic growth , which will be much lower in 2009 than in previous years , has been damaged .
trade has decreased , which will weaken these countriescurrent account balances .
at the same time , emigrant remittances have fallen and official development assistance has also been reduced .
one common feature is the increase in the financing needs of many countries .
on 21 april , the commission will publish its yearly spring development package of proposals to member states .
this year , the focus will be on the actions that remain necessary to achieve the mdgs .
the package will adopt a comprehensive approach and define an action plan for accelerated progress towards the mdgs .
ro the economic and financial crisis has also hit moldova , a developing country , very hard .
direct investment needs to be encouraged .
the cost of money transfers made by emigrants from the countries they work in must be reduced .
the agreement was reached today by prime minister vlad filat during the donor conference .
i am glad that mr guerrero has taken up these proposals and I congratulate him on his splendid report .
sv mr president , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his important report .
in a few daystime , the acp eu joint parliamentary assembly will meet in tenerife .
they need trade , but our policy counteracts the establishment of healthy markets for agricultural products in developing countries .
the eu has shown leadership says the commissioner , but we can do much better .
it is a matter of fair trade , commissioner .
yet it is foreign debt that continues to be the principal drain on the resources of developing countries .
cancelling the debt is simply a matter of justice .
keeping to the speaking time , too , is a matter of fairness .
the countries of europe are getting themselves ever deeper into debt in order to restart their economies .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 20written statements rule 149 
by implementing these actions , the european union must be the leader and act more resolutely .
the economic crisis is already affecting the population directly , while unemployment is on the rise in developing countries .
eu funding programmes are the most comprehensive and inclusive among the financial aid schemes available globally .
the sitting was closed at 23.15 
this makes us aware that the problem of terrorism in europe has not yet been solved .
theladies in whiteare mothers and wives of imprisoned opposition activists .
in 2005 , the european parliament awarded theladies in whitethe sakharov prize .
we join today with those heroic women , and we are thinking about them and their difficult situation .		
my report on the ecb's 2008 annual report was drafted in this context .
i hope that a good balance has been found .
the financial and economic crisis has seen the worst global economic decline since the 1930s .
most member states are experiencing rising budgetary deficits and debts .
i believe that the ecb has responded fairly well to the crisis .
the primary function of the ecb is to maintain price stability .
instead , many banks have used the liquidity to buttress their own position .
to justified public revulsion , it has allowed them to make bonus payments as well .
however , I will leave it to my colleagues here perhaps to amplify on this .
this is something to build upon .
we must strengthen that accountability .
the economic situation is a matter of major concern for the citizens of europe and for all of us .
i would like to present the report against this background .
this is the price which we have to pay in order to emerge from the crisis .
the report's message in this respect is very clear .
we must return to the path taken by the stability and growth pact as quickly as possible .
we cannot pass on this level of debt to our children and grandchildren .
i would like to summarise briefly our proposals in this respect .
firstly , we need effective instruments for economic coordination .
secondly , the structural dependency of the euro area on finite resources must be brought to an end .
thirdly , it is essential that the financial markets are effectively regulated after this crisis .
instead , individual member states are expected to use ridiculous interest rates in order to finance their debts .
the report also calls for the implementation of a country by country reporting system for corporate income .
we are asking you to submit a corresponding proposal .
however , this gives me the opportunity to discuss the current situation at the end of the debate .
first , on the economic developments and monetary policy over the past year .
in particular , we scaled back the number , frequency and maturity of longer term refinancing operations .
i therefore welcome the repeated support by the committee on economic and monetary affairs for our quarterly monetary dialogue .
we consider the ecb to be one of the world's most transparent central banks .
certain financial instruments which were introduced for hedging should not be misused for speculation .
let me say just a word on the outlook for emu during challenging times .
an economic recovery is in progress , but this does not mean that the crisis is over .
for another , we are still facing numerous challenges regarding the reform of our financial system .
finance must play a constructive role , and not a destructive one , in our economies .
the litmus test for a constructive role is that finance serves the real economy .
to ensure such a role , we still need to improve the functioning of financial systems considerably further .
thus far , a great deal of attention has been focused on the banking sector .
we have to contain systemic disruptions that lead to economic hardship for the people of europe .
within europe's economic and monetary union , there is a clear allocation of responsibilities .
the commitment of the ecb , the strategy of the ecb and its track record are consistent .
policy makers at the national level must keep public finances sound and their economies competitive .
monetary union in europe is far more , in my opinion , than a monetary arrangement .
it is a union of shared destiny .
the speaker added in french and german we share a destiny in common .
this destiny is for our common good , and it is the vision of our founding fathers .
monetary union is not a matter of convenience .
i believe we often play down the achievement that europe has attained .
but they have generally worked well , even in the most difficult times .
i trust that european institutions and processes have remained effective during the financial crisis .
let me conclude .
the global financial crisis has brought fresh challenges to which we in europe have risen .
today , europe faces further pivotal decisions .
for this we need strengthened surveillance as again was said by the rapporteurs , and strengthened cooperation .
we also need to revive the sense of common purpose , the shared ideals that motivated our founding fathers .
their endeavour was visionary and all that we see in today's world confirms their lucidity .
when we prepared our annual statement , we knew that the selected issues would be topical .
they might , however , have become somewhat too topical recently .
let me congratulate both rapporteurs , edward scicluna and sven giegold , for their excellent reports .
since 1999 , the euro area has mostly been an area of economic stability .
it has shielded our citizens from economic turbulences .
this moment may indeed be a turning point in greek fiscal history and economic development .
the greek crisis has demonstrated the need for enhanced economic governance .
this was already recognised and the legal base provided in the lisbon treaty .
therefore , an integrated and forward looking approach focused on policy action and clear operational arrangements is needed .
i also count on your support in this matter .
we can also make better use of existing instruments .
this has been used in the past , probably too rarely .
that is the second core element of reinforced economic governance .
by and large , I share the views of the rapporteur in this regard .
today , the worst may be over .
the economic recovery is now in progress but it is still fragile and not self sustaining .
unemployment has not yet changed for the better .
the same applies to the consolidation of public finances , which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth .
these clouds will overshadow our economic landscape in the coming years .
we must do our utmost to clear the sky and bring back growth .
therefore , this is indeed no time for business as usual .
instead , this is time for a change in step to promote sustainable growth and job creation .
i have learnt two main lessons from this crisis .
on the one hand , the economic and monetary union has shown how useful it is .
the euro , a stable common currency , has played the part of a real monetary shield .
the euro area has therefore become more attractive , as the case of iceland shows .
from this I draw the second lesson , which is that we should strengthen european economic governance .
today , the only genuine european economic policy is monetary policy .
there is limited coordination of budget policies .
reducing public debt remains a fundamental commitment , as it concerns our children's future .
let us be austere , but let us also be inventive .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr giegold's report is particularly significant given the current macro economic debate .
this crisis is far from behind us .
they will exacerbate unemployment and will fuel social tensions .
the giegold report has the merit of drawing attention to some of these macro economic imbalances .
we held long discussions with them and in the end , agreed on many compromise amendments .
i would like to talk to you today about the euro .
it is , in fact , the only major western currency that has not made its users poorer .
the euro poses no risk to the mediterranean economies .
we in the euro area must not penalise the countries that export the most .
nevertheless , under no circumstances must its export strength be weakened .
those who do best cannot be penalised .
i would like , starting from where we are today , to take a look forward .
where are we ?
second , we cannot ignore the fact that we already have huge and deepening social inequalities .
so what we believe is that we should really switch gear .
of course .
what does that mean ?
greece has 4 % of its gdp going to military spending .
they have got an air force that is as big as the luftwaffe .
i mean , how come ?
it is such a tiny country and they are arming themselves like hell .
but if we just look at the expenditure side , we will not succeed .
we need to rebalance tax income away from labour income towards other forms of income , including capital income .
and we cannot do that just by asking countries to coordinate their policies .
we need more integration .
so I believe that europe is now at a critical juncture .
the choice is between a higher degree of integration , not just coordination , and decline .
the lesson that I take from copenhagen is not just that we missed the climate agreement .
it is that europe has proved to be irrelevant if it is not acting together .
we spend too much time coordinating , too little time acting together .
so that would be our contribution to this debate .
however , the euro does not sit in isolation .
while they may be united by a common currency , attitudes towards saving and spending vary considerably .
joining a monetary union did not unite completely different cultures and traditions of fiscal policy .
the uk perspective has a lot to say on differences in fiscal policy .
fundamentally , money to fund the public sector does not magically appear .
it comes from tax receipts from the private sector .
germany realises this .
hence , it is now in a strong position for recovery .
ultimately , the public sector has done its job in the crisis .
it bailed out the banks and stepped up when the private sector failed .
now it is the turn of the private sector to replenish the coffers .
on the one hand , we are talking about a community with a common destiny .
that is preposterous !
most importantly , this would be an admission of failure which would amount to kowtowing to the financial sector .
taking this route would be the equivalent of driving the eu project into a wall .
the euro cannot provide the answer to the different levels of productivity in the individual economies .
major exporters such as germany are forcing greek economic policy to its knees .
therefore , this also represents a crisis in eu economic and competition policy .
this is why we are calling for the ban on financial assistance for eu member states to be lifted .
this is what we are calling for .
mr president , 25 march is the birthday of both europe and greece .
on 25 march 1957 , the european union was born under the treaty of rome .
on 25 march 1821 , greece was born .
many people will say it serves greece right and it should pay for its mistakes .
yes , certain people must be called to account for this .
thank you , sir .
your time has run out .
de mr president , I would like to raise a point of order .
however , inflation is also a cause for concern and you are making good progress in this area .
as an austrian , I would like to advise against the germany bashing that has been taking place here .
everyone should be aware germany has been the source of a great deal of stability in the past .
it should not now be punished because it has achieved better results in many areas than other countries .
mr trichet and mr rehn were of the same opinion .
mr scicluna's report reflects this approach .
like a tanker on the high seas , the ecb must stay on the correct course .
this should be an important criterion for future assessments of other measures taken by the central bank .
the gravity of the situation has been accurately described .
this morning , I have heard so many speeches exalting the virtues of the euro .
adon abbondio europeis of no use to us .
if europe does not show courage today , when will it have to show courage ?
but there are indicators beyond the stability and growth pact that need respecting too .
greater fiscal coordination linked to macro economic stability is an option .
but this has been tried , of course .
so we know the lesson exerting discipline in times of surplus is even harder than policing deficit .
and , just like in the financial markets , failure to do so ends in crisis .
this , too , does not necessarily have a deficit trigger .
often , it has simply been reinvested in assets bearing higher interest .
and I dare say some of these were even recirculated on repo to the ecb .
no doubt in some quarter , such activity is even viewed as deserving of a bonus .
it identifies elements of social cohesion which are not present in similar debates in the european parliament .
the euro should be accompanied by a minimum social security indicator for social cohesion .
that is clear from the various things being said in greece , much of which is inaccurate .
that is clear from eurostat statistics it was approximately 90 % in both 2007 and 200of course there is wastage , but people are also being recruited to the public sector in various forms . 
these days , the imf is the right organisation to help greece out of the crisis .
if that does not work , then we need to be decisive and cut the gordian knot .
countries that are not playing by the rules of the euro area must leave the game .
mr president , let us try and learn from this situation .
when it joined the euro , greece was as unpredictable as the oracle at delphi .
the figures it submitted were unclear and unreliable .
that is turning the world on its head .
anyone who submits unsound figures cannot point accusing fingers at anybody else .
if not , should you not have known that ?
i hope you can give me a straight answer to that question .
the capitalist crisis has resulted in a spiralling deterioration in the living standards of the workers .
it is a harsh policy exercised solely on the basis of the criterion of the profitability of capital .
it has channelled over eur 1 trillion to the banks and monopoly groups .
let us bring it all down to earth just a little bit shall we ?
unemployment , youth unemployment in the iberian peninsula and many eurozone countries is chronic .
it has been at 30 40 % for years .
nothing to do with the crisis at all .
a complete disaster .
gdp per capita in the usa is miles ahead of the european union .
gdp in the pacific rim is miles ahead of the gdp in the union .
no , the euro has not been successful at all .
it is already failing .
it is already crumbling before our eyes .
just look at some economic basics .
there is no lender .
this is impossible in global , in currency management , whether it is an optimal currency zone or not .
there is no coordinated fiscal policy so it is doomed to failure and it is failing as we speak .
let me just remind everybody here about something else if I may .
far too many of us .
ro the mafia is the major cause of the crisis .
i will give you a few examples from my own country , romania .
since 1990 , approximately 6 000 companies valued at eur 700 billion have been privatised fraudulently .
unfortunately , only eur 7 billion , or 1 % of this money , has been received so far .
this is no longer a market economy , but a jungle economy .
just like 100 years ago , the balkan peninsula is sitting on a powder keg .
the flame of social protest may quickly spread from greece to the other countries in the region .
starvation is the most powerful electoral factor in history .
however , there is one hope of salvation radical solutions are required at such an historic crossroads .
it is not under control the mafia needs to be , but under the ground .
mr rehn , I would like to remind you that you have some huge tasks ahead .
we need a more automated system .
we do not need economic governance under the control of finance ministers .
i would like to make two remarks about what mr trichet has said on the euro area .
secondly , the eu has largely succeeded in balancing its accounts , thanks to the countries in surplus .
they have to export their goods .
that is not sufficient .
we have enough to do ourselves with the budgetary consolidation .
it is important not to underestimate the work involved .
this is not a true european policy .
therefore , I would like to wish the commission courage and give my warm thanks to the ecb .
without doubt , the basic responsibility for this situation lies with greece and it has fully assumed it .
however , there are other collective responsibilities .
the common currency has provided a great deal , but it also has serious weaknesses .
the alternative , if it fails , would , of course , be a frightening prospect .
the ecb has been a bastion of strength when the financial storms have hit .
greece's problems and those of other euro area countries cannot be blamed on the euro .
careless expansion of public expenditure will result in problems regardless of the choice of currency .
the deficit is still extremely large .
i would like to finish by saying something about speculation .
the language of war does not suit the style of banks .
only two are in euroland .
my point of view , therefore , will be different .
does this mean we are lazy ?
greece is currently going through a crisis because it entered that oasis of stability too soon .
we should avoid such inconsistency .
the economic situation in numerous countries is clearly negative .
the measures being taken to address deficits are exacerbating the crisis .
mr trichet and mr rehn and I am speaking institutionally did you not see the crisis coming ?
the signs were there .
in my opinion , the problem in the european union and in greece is not one of sound finances .
as such , I would say to you that what is needed is a change to the stability pact .
financial assistance for greece should come primarily from the international monetary fund imf .
the imf has itself said that it is in an excellent position to help greece .
the necessity and desirability of setting up an emf are dubious .
it is really up to the council now to make a move .
twenty member states currently have excessive deficits .
greater economic union may make the difference .
global imbalances need to be corrected .
the european union is one of the most balanced regions .
that could come under threat unless its competitiveness is strengthened and there is greater international monetary cooperation .
the efforts and courage of greece deserve clear and resolute support .
it is a question of common interest and uncertainty harms all europeans .
subsidiarity and solidarity are two sides of the same coin the european currency .
i have repeated it in spanish , which is one of the european union's global languages .
the public funds of many member states have declined as a result of this crisis .
to deal with this issue , the irish government took decisive action in the years 2008 and 200unchecked , ireland's deficit was heading towards 14 % of gdp .
the government's action stabilised the deficit at 11.6 % of gdp in 20the action taken by the government has gained recognition in international markets .
in many ways , ireland is ahead of many other countries in its fiscal adjustment .
we have to ask whether some states should have entered the euro area as early as they did .
european taxpayers in many countries may , today , pay a great deal for this haste .
it would be good if we could draw some conclusions from this lesson for the future .
it is true that many are demanding economic governance .
the greek crisis is telling it is germany that has control and is imposing its demands .
the ecb will have an important role in this area .
the pact's main aim was prevention .
it was meant to provide multilateral supervision of budgetary development using an early warning system .
estonia is practically the only eu member state that currently satisfies the maastricht criteria .
mr president , 2008 was an extremely important year for the european and indeed the global economy .
this was no easy year for the ecb , which had to face a number of challenges .
i agree that 2008 was instrumental and that those responsible have risen to this occasion .
quite clearly , I am sorry to hear this .
this is what we must take into account .
we must take this into account for two reasons .
this is the spirit that we have to discover .
this is the magic panacea that we need .
in the search for remedies , key indicators are the sustainability of public finances and the deficit .
we just have to observe strict budget discipline in public finances .
firstly , we should not devote the debate on public finances to issues relating to austerity alone .
we also need to focus on what we can do to initiate growth and combat unemployment .
in many countries , cuts in public expenditure are needed .
there is still much to do in this regard .
transparency is not only an excellent way to counter harmful risk taking behaviour on the financial market .
the ecb should lead the way in this area and take immediate measures to make its work more transparent .
a good first step would be to begin to publish the minutes of the ecb council meetings .
openness should also be a key principle in the establishment of the european systemic risk board esrb .
we must not allow the financial crisis to slow down the switch to a green economy .
only by making these kinds of investments can we create growth that is sustainable in the long term .
in 2009 , monetary instability could have weakened the political solidity of the european union .
but for how much longer ?
solidarity goes hand in hand with solidity in the emotionally charged context of sovereign debt markets .
the political prevaricating of recent weeks has not only damaged greece .
it has seriously shaken confidence in the euro .
non assistance to countries in danger is undermining the monetary stability of the whole of the euro area .
beyond emergencies , let us finally give the euro the instruments it needs .
we need representation outside the euro area at all levels , in all bodies , including international financial institutions .
why is the president of the eurogroup not in the g20 ?
we must welcome them with enthusiasm , not with petty mindedness .
contriving to exclude euro area members amounts to abandoning the ambition of a strong europe in the world .
this is the price of the euro's continued success .
let us think about how this illness , which we call the crisis , arose .
the cause of the crisis was activity which was contrary to market principles speculative activity .
globalisation has led to the establishment of world financial institutions and a global finance market .
it is a pity that the warnings from the commission were too gentle .
some member states behaved like children , hiding their misdeeds .
this kind of behaviour cannot be the basis of community or our integration .
we must take action so that the costs of the crisis do not fall on the weakest and poorest .
european union solidarity obliges us also to support the countries which have been worst hit by the crisis .
you have been competent , independent and consistent .
you and your staff have been a calming influence in troubled times .
mr rehn , you have made some very encouraging statements over the last few days .
we should do everything possible to continue on the path that you have taken .
the euro is a stabilising force , even in times of crisis .
on the contrary , it is part of the solution .
there can be no reform without the euro .
greece cannot be given subsidies , but it wants support for implementing its reform and savings plan .
no one has said that nothing could be done .
we have a monetary union , but we do not have an economic union .
to achieve an economic union , we need the political will of the member states rather than advice .
this is what we are calling on the member states to do and we expect them to show commitment .
we must continue on this route in the interests of the euro .
pl mr president , last year was an extremely turbulent one for the euro area .
during this period , the world experienced its biggest economic crisis for years .
the resolution we are considering at the moment is part of this debate .
i would like to draw attention to one aspect of it .
therefore , let us not exclude the new member states from such an important debate .
we have had thetwo speed europeslogan .
my country , slovakia , is no exception to the rule .
unemployment has risen above 13 % .
the vast majority of the population still feels positive about the euro .
we think it is important therefore to maintain the strength and prestige of the euro .
parliament must help the commission and the ecb in their efforts in order to avoid failure in this endeavour .
support for economic activity , in particular , small and medium sized enterprises , was not coordinated either .
my party is pleased that the uk remains outside the eurozone .
however , keeping our own currency is only part of the answer .
the single currency has not provided a solution to all the internal and external imbalances which have occurred .
those groups which are not responsible for the crisis must not now be made to bear the cost .
if we do not invest in people , we will not have a future in europe .
this is why I am calling for the emphasis to be put on the social aspect in future .
globalisation is compelling the euro area to play an effective role with regard to financial policy .
we are not going back to business as usual .
we have to remain extremely alert .
i also got the message on growth and jobs , which is a very strong message from parliament .
i fully agree with that .
we absolutely need full and complete implementation of the stability and growth pact .
this is a key issue .
i do not want to elaborate more on greece and the various issues at stake .
let me only say that greece has a role model , and the role model is ireland .
i want to stress that .
you can trust us .
we can prove that .
this is not theory .
these are facts these are figures .
they must draw consequences from this nationally .
they benefit from belonging to the euro area .
we are a college .
the governing council is the pertinent entity .
it is the governing council which counts .
i have listened to your views very carefully .
i would like to consult you and move forward soon with concrete proposals .
there are two lines of action in reinforcing economic governance which are of the essence .
binding policy recommendations will also be used in this regard .
this is needed to prevent an accumulation of imbalances .
rapporteur . mr president , a few points first .
we have seen that the recent recession is proving to be a challenge .
however the tensions in the euro area are not new and are well known .
we know we are not yet an optimal currency area .
however , that is why we have to be innovative .
we have to follow sensible economic principles and policies .
of course , they must be couched in line with european social cohesion principles .
some can be executed in the short term and others in the medium term .
we need to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude does not occur again .
rapporteur . mr president , following this debate , I would like to make three quick points .
there were differences which were quite clear and I think we have to be careful .
some countries had cost increases which were too high , and it is good that you are acting .
i urge you not to be blind in one eye and I urge my colleagues likewise .
look at greece and the stability programme , which was praised .
if you praise the irish efforts , you cannot compare it to the situation in greece .
people in greece feel they should not suffer because of things they have not caused .
otherwise , the programme will be not accepted and it will also fail for economic reasons .
we have to make sure that the programme is socially just and it is not yet socially just .
the vote will take place on thursday , 25 march 20written statements rule 149 
in writing . there are lessons to be learnt from the current eurozone crisis .
better coordination would enhance euro area stability .
the sgp needs to be respected strictly , but I think it should be revised .
the preventive arm should be strengthened .
without the functioning eurozone , overcoming the crisis would have been much slower and uneven .
this applies also for those member states which have not yet joined the eurozone .
there is a general agreement that the economic crisis was a logical outcome of a widespread crisis of values .
those who have joined the eurozone are expected to bear higher responsibility for balancing their expenses and incomes .
it does not make sense to take the role of supposed victims of financial speculation or economic mafias .
almost all european economies have sinned against the principles of sound and balanced fiscal policy .
the first cause of this justified criticism is the objectives of the bank .
all of this only confirms the harmfulness of the current concept of the european central bank .
the report must therefore be rejected .
the european union as a whole and the euro area in particular are in a grave situation .
greece is on the verge of bankruptcy and spain and portugal are also in difficulties .
because of the seriousness of the situation , new proposals are constantly being made .
on the one hand , people are talking about giving the european monetary fund extensive rights of intervention .
however , taking another huge step towards a centralised european superstate will not solve the existing problems .
on the contrary , it will further exacerbate them .
the european union should stop exposing itself voluntarily to the problems of us financial policy .
the euro is an anchor to which the member state economies are tied .
actions by any member state which weaken the euro are unacceptable .
i consider it essential that every country fulfils the conditions set up for the euro area .

* * *
this is in paragraph 108 of the ruling .
consequently , it believes that I can no longer cite prejudice .
the fact remains that it is ordering our parliament to pay two thirds of the legal costs .
this decision therefore constitutes a scathing rejection of the partisan tactics that deprived me of parliamentary immunity .
under pressure , the rapporteur resorted to a crude procedural trick .

second european roma summit
it becomes the consequence of paragraph mr president , thank you very much .
we have two amendments , one of which is an amendment to the amendment .
i would like to introduce both of them .
we would like the wordsthe council andto be deleted .
the final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be 
schengen borders code with regard to surveillance of external maritime borders
before the adoption of the draft resolution 
we cannot open a debate on that now , mr busuttil .
you have the floor , but we cannot open a debate .
this is why we rejected them .
if you vote for this , you are not .
it is pure clarity .
priorities for the 2011 budget section iii commission 
welcome
we warmly welcome mr tabarki and the members of his delegation .
we therefore wish you an enjoyable and fruitful visit .

the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation 
as agreed , I will now read the second part of the english version .
mr guerrero indicated that it did indeed affect the second part of paragraph 34 
now it is all clear .
the vote took place 
parliament accepted the oral amendment 
before the vote on paragraph 22 
fr mr president , we have brought to your attention an oral amendment concerning paragraph fr mr president , you called for  for the tunisian delegation a moment ago .
de mr president , I would like to raise a point of order .
i am very happy about the way that the vote has gone .
however , this was essentially an own initiative report and a different procedure has been agreed in this case .
now we have been allowed to have individual votes on an own initiative report .
we need to resolve this or all own initiative reports will have individual votes in future .
could you perhaps ask the committee on constitutional affairs to clarify this issue ?
otherwise , the interpretation made by the house's services will defeat the whole object of the reform .
mr swoboda , it can be done .
it could be revised in the future , but for the moment , that is how it is .
ecb annual report for 2008 
 vote time continued 
the causes of this situation are varied .										
that is a fact .
the economic and social disadvantages of the roma have yet again been ascribed to so called intolerance and discrimination .
their values and norms are directly at odds with our own .
we can observe similar tendencies in our countries now .
i disagree with that .
the contrary is true .
however , this parliament is calling for even more so called decentralised agencies .
i repeat that , as I see it , we have too many of these already .
next year's budget must not be drawn up as if these were ordinary times .
unfortunately , the economic crisis is not yet over , and we cannot ignore it .
the european union is very good at spending money at spending other people's money .
we are much more careful with the latter than with the former .
that explains what is happening in europe today .
all of the member states are looking for budget reductions .
eu citizens and discerning consumers must therefore be fully informed as to their advantages .
i therefore fully support the introduction of a european quality logo for products originating exclusively from the eu .
the logo officially recognises the efforts of european farmers and provides protection for intellectual property at the international level .
i firmly believe that this will help many rural areas which have no other development opportunities .
there should be a clear divide .
these are the reasons why I voted for this report .
mr president , may I also thank mr scottà for the work in this important report .
it also supports the introduction of comprehensive and compulsory legislation forplace of farminglabelling .
we have done a good job .
my compliments to those members who have worked on this dossier .
mr president , in principle , I have no problem with the idea of quality logos .
we see quality logos in a number of areas of our life .
just so long as this is not being used as an excuse to override the choices of the consumer .
human life is sacred from conception until natural death , and therefore I could not support this report .
it is poor people and poor countries that are suffering the most as a result of the economic crisis .
we should give all the help we can with regard to public investment , particularly in these countries .
it is not for this place to determine whether access to abortion is a right or not .
it is a matter for national governments to legislate .
nl mr president , as parliament , we ought to think twice before making proposals .
we ought to be making proposals for policies that will solve problems , not exacerbate them .
that was my first point .
i will be very brief with my second point .
reproductive health organisations support abortion as one of the ways of controlling the birth rate .
in my opinion , the eu wastes financial resources on birth control , which does not solve poverty .
that is why I have voted against paragraph 7 and against the entire report .
i think it was john maynard keynes who wrotehe who controls the currency controls the country.
i promise that is the only time I am going to quote keynes approvingly .
in fact , let me give you a higher and better authority even than john maynard keynes .
i refer you to the gospel of st matthew , chapter I am sure you will remember this .
our lord is asked whether it is proper to pay taxes to rome .
he says why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
show me the tribute money.
and they brought unto him a penny .
and [ jesus ] saith unto them ,whose is this image and superscription ? 
they say unto him caesar's.
and so we have seen that the euro leads to common economic government .
thank heaven we had the foresight to keep the pound .
thank you for blessing this morning's session , mr hannan .
but let us look at some of the things that we propose .
de mr president , ladies and gentlemen , I have voted against this report for two reasons .
this does not change the fact that abortion means killing an unborn child .
mr president , I voted against this report because it is a silly report .
it is an irrelevant report .
you will now collect about usd 6 trillion worth of capital .
why are we not working to keep that capital in those countries making those countries richer ?
no , what did we go and do just now ?
so , like other speakers , we objected to that and voted against that section .
da mr president , we in the danish people's party voted against this report .
we want to decide for ourselves what economic policy we wish to pursue .
it is the danish electorate and not economists in frankfurt who should decide this 														 
this will involve the united kingdom being given a legal obligation to allow imports from these countries .
this will involve competition for our farmers and a further erosion of sovereignty .
as a result of this pairing of good and bad proposals , we decided to abstain .
now , imitation products must be clearly labelled .
it is important to put in place provisions relating to animal health and hygiene .
in writing . I votedyesat the final vote on this resolution .
we greens agree with the procedure .
the european union can do a great deal here .
this has been leading to redundancies there too , exacerbating the region's social situation .
explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rules of procedure 
the large majority voting in favour in the competent parliamentary committee confirms the measure's apparent soundness .
given this , I see no reason to vote against the mobilisation of the fund in this case .
this support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocations that occur in the context of globalisation .
the sums are not big for the eu but they will alleviate the hardships lithuanian workers are facing .
we believe that member states should help their own redundant workers .
we must therefore vote for the fund to be used appropriately for other member states .
it is the thought of the lithuanian workers sacrificed on the altar of globalisation that prompts me to abstain .
however , what little is given may relieve their pain .
the logic of the european globalisation adjustment fund is still intolerable nonetheless .
in the kingdom of eurocrats , a clear conscience comes cheap .
growth and solidarity those are the two key words that must guide our european economic strategy .
growth , because , without it , we will be unable to take up the social challenge .
solidarity , because it is the raison d être of european integration and will be its future .
this right is enshrined in the treaties , including the treaty of lisbon .
i voted for the 2009 annual statement on the euro area and public finances .
furthermore , we must pay particular attention to the problems associated with fiscal discipline .
at the same time , member states and the european commission must work together to reduce fiscal imbalances .
the irish labour party does not support the introduction of ccctb .
i abstained from voting on this particular report .
the specific problem is not one ofsoundfinances .
the need for stricter regulation and supervision of the financial crisis is as urgent as ever .
a ccctb is not about a common tax rate .
taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each member state .
in writing . I do not support paragraph 29 as it calls for the introduction of ccctb .
clearly , this europe is yet another enemy of the people .
we must learn lessons from the mistakes made so that they can be avoided in the future .
as predicted by economists , 2009 was the most difficult for crisis hit member states .
the costs of fighting the crisis have led to a drastic worsening of the situation of public finances .
for the euro area , the financial crisis has proved to be the greatest challenge in its history .
the crisis has ruthlessly laid bare the weaknesses of the common currency system .
we only need to carry out that process rationally .
mr constâncio has an impressive cv .
we will continue to fight these policies , regardless of who is involved in their management .
we would so very much like to believe him .
i made the provocative comment that this is a bit like giving sticks of dynamite to a pyromaniac .
these words were echoed loudly in portugal .
i spent several months in 2008 participating in a committee of enquiry for the portuguese parliament .
it discovered and reported serious failures of supervision , which resulted in the nationalisation of a bank in 200i am referring to banco português de negócios and banco privado português .
i supported the nomination of mrs rasa budbergytas a member of the european court of auditors .
if appointed to this office , she promises to carry out her work according to two principles .
i am convinced that the auditor has proved her competence and professionalism in the area of auditing .
i am sure that her faultless work will be an excellent contribution to the entire european union .
objections by anyone who does not wish to see the appointment in question take place are understandable .
that being the case , my abstention is justified .
in writing . the vote in favour of mr fazakas is disappointing .
it sets a serious precedent .
this was no ordinary vote .
mr fazakas is suspected of being an ex collaborator of the communist secret services .
the hungarian press produced a document regarding this .
a number of opinions were heard that opposed anypunishmentagainst mr fazakas .
they asked for the past not to be revived .
this is wrong .
the past is not dead .
tens of millions of eastern europeans still live a life troubled by the communist horrors .
this would be a recipe for the politics of diminished responsibility .
public office would lose dignity .
anyone , however corrupt or immoral , could stand for public office .
the perpetrators of the communist indignity should not be part of a democratic order they tried to suppress .
mr fazakas hid his past and lied when asked about it .
this lack of honesty should not be rewarded .
he is currently undersecretary of state at the ministry of regional development .
mr kubik performed very well during the european parliament hearing , and his candidature has not raised any doubts .
in view of this , I decided to endorse his candidacy .
it operates with complete independence .
in writing . I fully endorse these recommendations .
the eu and its member states are significant contributors to the un's budget .
i believe that an eu seat in an enlarged security council should remain a goal of the european union .
the ambition to gain an eu seat within an enlarged security council has to be pursued .
the member states should make every effort to have this matter included in the assembly's agenda .
there are many issues of interest at global level .
any attempt to reduce , weaken or postpone the promises made must be fought .
it is therefore important to attempt to reach agreement between developed and developing countries on speeding up progress .
in addition , another crucial question is assistance in maintaining order and in rebuilding a disaster hit country .
i find it impossible to vote for this text , although I do admit that it has certain qualities .
it is true that it promotes the non proliferation of nuclear weapons and the control of all weapons .
it is true that it promotes the abolition of capital punishment .
reform of the development cooperation system , which is covered in the report , must also be supported .
this needs to be tackled urgently as the current development aid policy can be seen to have failed .
development aid must be reviewed , reorganised and restructured together with the developing countries .
for this reason , I abstained during the final vote .
furthermore , the report consistently links civil and military instruments , which is something that I cannot support .
only once we have found a common european approach on european roma issues will the strategy be actively implemented .
in romania , according to some estimates , the roma minority amounts to more than 2 million .
this is larger than the hungarian minority and , some would logically say , stronger .
this fact may also be the reason that all the national social inclusion programmes have completely failed .
education is the key to the integration process .
by offering education and training , we are fighting exclusion , unemployment and discrimination .
we are also guaranteeing a society that is more fair , more creative and more dynamic .
protecting fundamental rights and creating a common area of freedom , security and justice are objectives of european integration .
it is important to adopt a common position on structural and pre accession funding policy .
the members of this ethnic minority continue to suffer discrimination and social exclusion , despite efforts to integrate them .
the eu has been supporting the member states in their efforts to implement effective policies .
there must be discussion of the results in april at the second european roma summit in córdoba .
it will fall to sociologists and historians to assess the causes and consequences of the issues surrounding the roma .
it is demanded of politicians that they be capable of doing something for the communities that they serve .
genericintegrationis not enough .
it is for these reasons that I abstained on the resolution , and dissented from my political group .
